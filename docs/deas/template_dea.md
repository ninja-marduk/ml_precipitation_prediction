# [Representative Name of the Change]

## Description
### Motivation
- **Context and Problem Description:** Why the change is proposed, what problem it aims to solve, and the current situation.

### Objectives
- **Expected Outcome:** Why it is important/necessary to solve the stated problem.

### Non-Goals
- **Out of Scope:** What problems are not expected to be solved and why these issues are outside the scope of the solution.

## Analyzed Solutions
At least two alternatives should be considered, including the "Do Nothing" option to maintain the current status. Focus should be on the trade-offs proposed for each alternative.

- **High-Level Diagram:** Start with a high-level diagram and detail the solution.
- **Interaction with Other Components:** Include a context or interaction diagram when the solution involves interactions with other components.

### Alternative 1..N
- **Functional Description:** Describe each analyzed alternative, incorporating necessary resources to explain the proposed solution (diagrams, images, pseudocode). Use of PlantUML is recommended for constructing diagrams.

#### Pros
- List the advantages of opting for the described alternative.

#### Cons
- List the disadvantages (detail the trade-offs of each alternative).

## Comparative Analysis
- **Table:** Compare the analyzed alternatives against various important criteria. Assign a numeric factor from 1 to 5 to dimension the impact of each alternative based on the evaluation criteria.
