   abstract = {Weather forecasting is a real time challenge that has been proven to be worst among the disaster in world over the last decade. Prediction begins even more complicated due to the ever-changing weather conditions. Many attributes have been negotiated with weather forecasting data that consider related attributes as independent variables. It is the cause of such natural disasters floods and droughts that meet people across globe every year. The higher accuracy of predicting rainfall is importance for countries like India as their economy depending on agriculture. Because of the mighty nature, few Statistical and Mathematical techniques fail to provide good rainfall accuracy prediction. The imbalance data of rainfall makes Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), MANN’s (LSTM, GRU, NTM) the best process. An effective climate analysis is required to understand the various factors that contribute to climate change. It is therefore necessary to identify the relationship among these qualities to better understanding of the weather data. The purpose of this paper to give non-professionals easy access to strategies as well methods used in the field of rain forecast and compare various results of various methods and algorithms used in research.},

   abstract = {Forecasts of crop yield are an important tool for a variety of stakeholders, but most studies produce large-scale, late-season yield forecasts that are not appropriate for farmers. Farmers require forecasts of crop yield mid-season and at fine spatial resolutions to guide site-specific adaptive crop management practices. This study created empirical random forest models to forecast cotton yield mid-season at three different spatial resolutions: 30 m, field, and farm aggregation. Large yield mapping datasets from 14 different seasons were utilised to build the model across 68 different fields from six large cotton farms in eastern Australia. A generic conceptual framework is proposed to empirically model crop yield. This topsaw framework represents the spatial and temporal factors that drive yield, including topography (t), organisms (o), plant measurements (p), soil (s), agronomy/management (a), and weather (w). In this study, the specific predictor variables to represent these driving factors of yield included elevation (t), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, MODIS Evapotranspiration (p), gamma radiometrics grid, clay content digital soil map (s), rainfall data, and growing day degrees (w). Forecasts of cotton yield increased in accuracy as the spatial resolution of predictions became coarser. Using a leave-one-year-out cross-validation, cotton yield could be forecasted to an accuracy of 0.42 Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11 bales ha−1 at 30 m resolution. This improved to a 0.63 LCCC and 1.72 bales ha−1 RMSE at the field resolution, and a 0.65 LCCC and 0.77 bales ha−1 at the aggregation-scale. As the developed approach solely relied on publicly available predictor variables, there is an opportunity to apply this to any cotton field in Australia, and over a much larger area. Overall, this study is an important step in building an operational approach to forecast mid-season cotton yield at fine spatial resolutions, and has the potential to improve production, input use efficiency, and profitability for individual growers and the Australian Cotton Industry as a whole.},

   abstract = {Runoff forecasting is an important approach for flood mitigation. Many machine learning models have been proposed for runoff forecasting in recent years. To reconstruct the time series of runoff data into a standard machine learning dataset, a sliding window method is usually used to pre-process the data, with the size of the window as a variable parameter which is commonly referred to as the time step. Conventional machine learning methods, such as artificial neural network models (ANN), require optimization of the time step because both too small and too large time steps reduce prediction accuracy. In this work two popular variants of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were employed to develop new data-driven flood forecasting models. GRU and LSTM models are in theory able to filter redundant information automatically, and therefore a large time step is expected to not reduce prediction accuracy. The three models (LSTM, GRU, and ANN) were applied to simulate runoff in the Yutan station control catchment, Fujian Province, Southeast China, using hourly discharge measurements of one runoff station and hourly rainfall of four rainfall stations from 2000 to 2014. Results show that the prediction accuracy of LSTM and GRU models increases with increasing time step, and eventually stabilizes. This allows selection of a relatively large time step in practical runoff prediction without first evaluating and optimizing the time step required by conventional machine learning models. We also show that LSTM and GRU models perform better than ANN models when the time step is optimized. GRU models have fewer parameters and less complicated structures compared to LSTM models, and our results show that GRU models perform equally well as LSTM models. GRU may be the preferred method in short term runoff predictions since it requires less time for model training.},

The diversity of ensemble techniques available for implementation in hydrological sciences has led to the development and utilization of different strategies in the implementation. This review paper explores and refers to the advancement of ensemble methods, including the resampling ensemble methods (e.g., bagging, boosting, and dagging), model averaging, and stacking viz. generalized stacked, in different application fields of hydrology. The main hydrological topics in this review study cover subjects such as surface hydrology, river water quality, rainfall-runoff, debris flow, river icing, sediment transport, groundwater, flooding, and drought modeling and forecasting. The general findings of this survey demonstrate the absolute superiority of using ensemble strategies over the regular (individual) model learning in hydrology. In addition, the boosting techniques (e.g., boosting, AdaBoost, and extreme gradient boosting) have been more frequent and successfully implemented in hydrological problems than the bagging, stacking, and dagging approaches.},

In addition, the method can predict the corrosion rates with variations of any one single environmental variable, like pH, temperature, relative humidity, SO2, rainfall or Cl−. By this way, the threshold of each variable, upon which the corrosion rate may have a large change, can be further obtained.},

However, over the past three decades they have been suffering from numerous health challenges, including changes in habitat, pollutants and toxins, pests and diseases, and competition for resources. An attempt to mitigate this problem is to estimate the health status of colonies and indicate an imminent collapsing state to beekeepers. To estimate the health status of bee colonies, we propose a method for calibrating a classification algorithm based on a supervised machine learning approach. We trained, validated, and tested three well-known and distinguished classification algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Neural Networks) and used real datasets from 6 apiaries, 27 Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) beehives monitored over three years (2016, 2017 and 2018). We used internal temperature and beehive weight as well as weather data (temperature, dew point, wind direction, wind speed, rainfall, and daylight). We also used 703 in loco apiary inspections made on a weekly basis to add to the data from sensors for the labeling needed in the training phase of supervised learning algorithms. The results suggest that we are proposing a high precision classification model (hit rate over 90%), which can be useful to self-predict healthy, unhealthy, and collapsing bee colony health states.},

   abstract = {Urban pluvial flooding is a threatening natural hazard in urban areas all over the world, especially in recent years given its increasing frequency of occurrence. In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events – especially in the future climate – this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning.},

Forecasting systems are one way to control the disease in its early stage, helping to prevent the spread of rice blast and reducing the use of chemicals. This paper proposes a system for rice blast disease forecasting using weather data. It aims to find the most effective of fifteen weather features by using the proposed ensemble method for ranking them. Furthermore, this study investigates the feature ranking results of the proposed method using five different classification models (Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors) over four classification evaluation metrics (F1 score, balanced accuracy, geometric mean, and ROC-AUC score). The experimental results demonstrate that the top ten features of the proposed ensemble feature ranking method have a higher classification performance than the other methods. The ranking of the final features for all classifiers reveals that average visibility, amount of rainfall, hours of sun, maximum wind speed, and days of rain are the five most effective weather features for rice blast disease prediction. Moreover, various classification models achieve satisfactory performance, especially those that are combined with feature selection.},

   abstract = {Turbidity is an indication of water quality and enables the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. For drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), violent fluctuations in turbidity are highly disruptive to operational performance due to the lag in process parameter adjustments. Such risks must be carefully managed to guarantee safe drinking water. Machine learning techniques have been proven to be effective for modeling complex nonlinear environmental systems, and this study adopted such a technique to develop a model for predicting source water turbidity for DWTPs to allow DWTPs to make proactive interventions in advance. A random forest (RF) model used preprocessed (empirical mode decomposition and quartile rejecting) meteorological factors (wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, and rainfall) as the input variables, to establish the turbidity prediction of a lake with significant turbidity in China's South Tai Lake. The modeling process included four main stages: (1) source data analysis, (2) raw data preprocessing, (3) modeling and tuning, and (4) model evaluation. The results of the RF model indicated that the correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual sequences is over 0.7, and more than 55% of the predicted values could control the errors within 20% compared to the actual measured values, suggesting that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting the turbidity of raw source water. It was found that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost because of its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. The findings of this study can inform the development of turbidity prediction models using readily available meteorological forecast data. The model can be applied to other DWTPs using similar shallow lakes as water sources.},

   abstract = {Making accurate and reliable probability density forecasts of flood processes is fundamentally challenging for machine learning techniques, especially when prediction targets are outside the range of training data. Conceptual hydrological models can reduce rainfall-runoff modelling errors with efficient quasi-physical mechanisms. The Monotone Composite Quantile Regression Neural Network (MCQRNN) is used for the first time to make probability density forecasts of flood processes and serves as a benchmark model, whereas it confronts the drawbacks of overfitting and biased-prediction. Here we propose an integrated model (i.e. XAJ-MCQRNN) that incorporates Xinanjiang conceptual model (XAJ) and MCQRNN to overcome the phenomena of error propagation and accumulation encountered in multi-step-ahead flood probability density forecasts. We consider flood forecasts as a function of rainfall factors and runoff data. The models are evaluated by long-term (2009–2015) 3-hour streamflow series of the Jianxi River catchment in China and rainfall products of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Results demonstrated that the proposed XAJ-MCQRNN model can not only outperform the MCQRNN model but also prominently enhance the accuracy and reliability of multi-step-ahead probability density forecasts of flood process. Regarding short-term forecasts in testing stages at four horizons, the XAJ-MCQRNN model achieved higher Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency but lower Root Mean Square Error values, while improving Coverage Ratio and Relative Bandwidth values in comparison to the MCQRNN model. Consequently, the improvement can benefit the mitigation of the impacts associated with uncertainties of extreme flood and rainfall events as well as promote the accuracy and reliability of flood forecasting and early warning.},

Nearly 58 percent of a country’s primary source of livelihood is farming. Farmers till date had adopted conventional farming techniques.

Precise farming helps to increase the productivity by precisely determining the steps that needs to be practiced at its due season.

Precise Farming uses advanced technologies such as IOT, Data Mining, Data Analytics, Machine Learning to collect the data, train the systems and predict the results. With the help of technologies Precise farming helps to reduce manual labor and increase productivity. Farmers have been facing various challenges in these recent times, this includes crop failure due to less rainfall, infertility of soil and so on. Due to the changes taking place in the environment the proposed work helps to identify how to manage crops and harvest in a smart way. It guides an individual for smart farming.

   abstract = {Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries in the world and the reliable prediction of wheat production plays a key role in ensuring regional and global food security. However, wheat yield in Australia is highly exposed to the impacts of climate variability, especially seasonal rainfall, as wheat is mostly grown in the drylands. Previous studies showed that El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a strong influence on Australia's climate and found the ENSO-related phenomena have prognostic features for future climatic conditions. Therefore, we examined the predictability of state-scale variation in Australian wheat yields based on ENSO-related large-scale climate precursors using machine learning techniques. Here, we firstly established a set of random forest (RF, a machine learning method) models based on pre-occurred climate indices to forecast spring rainfall for the four major wheat producing states of Australia, the forecasted rainfall was then combined with selected precedent climate drivers to predict yield variations using another set of RF models for each state. We explored the most influential variables in determining spring rainfall and yield variation. We found that the first set of RF models accounted for 43-59% of the change in spring rainfall across the four states. By incorporating forecasted spring rainfall with selected ENSO climate indices, the RF model accounted for 33-66% of the variation in yield which was greater than the 22-50% of yield variations explained by ENSO-related indices alone. The results suggest that wheat yield variation at a state level could be reliably forecasted at lead-times of three months prior to the commencement of harvest. We also found that forecasted spring rainfall and precedent Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in July were the most important factors in estimation of crop yield in the winter dominant rainfall states. ENSO climate indices are easy to obtain and can be rapidly used to drive the forecasting model. Therefore, we believe the proposed models for predicting wheat yield variations at three-month lead time would be helpful for state governments and policy makers to develop effective planning to reduce monetary loss and ensure food security.},

The evaluation metrics of Loss, RootMean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error were used to evaluatethe models’ performance. Results show that a Bidirectional-LSTM Network can be used as a rainfall forecastmodel with comparable performance to Stacked-LSTM Networks. Among all the models tested, the Stacked-LSTM Network with two hidden layers and the Bidirectional-LSTM Network performed best. This suggeststhat models based on LSTM-Networks with fewer hidden layers perform better for this approach; denoting itsability to be applied as an approach for budget-wise rainfall forecast applications.},

Besides, GW plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events. However, there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio-temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management, especially during drought events. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (SVMs), combined with data assimilation (DA) technique to predict the change in groundwater levels (CGWLs) at 1 to 3-month time scales for 46 GW wells located at the northeast United States. The in-situ climate variables and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission-informed groundwater anomalies data (GWA) are used to develop the models. The results suggest that SVMs (SVM-DA) models forced with limited climate variables (i.e., precipitation, solar radiation, air temperature, infrared surface temperature) can forecast the CGWLs up to 3-month lead times at most of the locations. The addition of GRACE data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of SVMs at most of the stations, where a strong relationship exists between the CGWLs and the GWA. The SVM-DA model comparatively performed better than SVMs at most of the stations.},

In this study, we applied a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the next few hours of rainfall observation imagery from NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement mission and its IMERG Early Run product in assist of hurricane predictions over the U.S.-Mexico Gulf coastal region. The IMERG Early Run is a satellite-based rainfall retrieval technique, providing rainfall measurement with a half-hourly temporal resolution, near-global scale coverage, and 4 h observation latency rainfall intensity imagery. The goal of this study is to extend the observation latency so that the IMERG Early Run product could potentially be used for real-time hurricane prediction and flash flood warning. In this study, we first build a sub-dataset from the IMERG Early Run product containing total 37 past hurricane events that hit the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) bordering the Gulf of Mexico from 2002 to 2019. Then, two CNN models with different model structures are built and tested to forecast the 37 hurricane events in a retrospective manner. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to select the optimal hyperparameters of the two CNN models, i.e., the number of convolution layers, filter size, minibatch size, number of filters, and pooling size. The prediction results show that the two employed CNN models generally provide satisfactory performance, showing averaged Accuracy in the categorical metrics is above 90% and averaged NSE in the continuous metrics is above 0.5. We found that the forecasting performance of the two CNN models is not significantly different; however, the CNN model without pooling layers always shows slightly better performance than the CNN model with pooling layers. We also found that both CNN models can predict the spatial range of hurricane rainfall well, but there are limitations to underestimate in larger rainfall rates. This study will serve as a novel investigation on how AI/ML models could help with real-time hurricane predictions, and provide a future reference for selecting the optimal CNN model parameters for processing spatial rainfall data.},

   abstract = {For landslides characterized with “step-like” deformation curves, the accelerations of the deformation during the rainy season are destructive for both residents and infrastructure; therefore, it is essential to perform displacement prediction. The aim of this study is to present a computational intelligence approach that adopts ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and extreme learning machine (ELM) method optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) to conduct displacement prediction. First, the cumulative displacement was decomposed by the EEMD method to obtain the trend and periodic components. The trend displacement was predicted by setting previous displacement data as an input variable. The external triggering factors were also decomposed by EEMD into several subsequences. Subsequences with periodic characteristics were selected as the input datasets to forecast the periodic displacements using an ELM model optimized by PSO (PSO-ELM). Finally, the total displacement was obtained by adding the two predictive components to validate the model performance. The Baishuihe landslide in the Three-Gorges area of China was selected as an example; long-term monitoring records from monitoring site ZG118 were utilized to validate the model. The results revealed that the prediction accuracy can be improved by deleting any random components in the triggering factors. The correlation coefficient and the root mean square error between the measured and predicted displacements were 0.996 and 7.62 mm, respectively, thus indicating satisfactory calculation accuracy for the trained model. Therefore, under the premise of available monitoring data, the PSO-ELM model was effective in forecasting landslide displacements with step-like curve in this region.},

   abstract = {Reliable prediction of rainfall extremes is vital for disaster management, particularly in the context of increasing rainfall extremes due to global climate change. Physical-empirical models have been developed in this study using three widely used Machine Learning (ML) methods namely, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks (BANN) for the prediction of rainfall and rainfall related extremes during Northeast Monsoon (NEM) in Peninsular Malaysia from synoptic predictors. The gridded daily rainfall data of Asian Precipitation—Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE) was used to estimate four rainfall indices namely, rainfall amount, average rainfall intensity, days having >95-th percentile rainfall, and total number of dry days in Peninsular Malaysia during NEM for the period 1951–2015. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis sea level pressure (SLP) data was used for the prediction of rainfall indices with different lead periods. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to select the SLP at different NCEP grid points which were found significantly correlated with NEM rainfall indices. The results showed superior performance of BANN among the ML models with normalised root mean square error of 0.04–0.14, Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency of 0.98–1.0, and modified agreement index of 0.97–0.99 and Kling-Gupta efficient index 0.65–0.96 for one-month lead period prediction. The 95% confidence interval (CI) band for BANN was found narrower than the other ML models. Almost all the forecasted values by BANN were also found with 95% CI, and therefore, the p-factor and the r-factor for BANN in predicting rainfall indices were found in the range of 0.95–1.0 and 0.25–0.49 respectively. Application of BANN in prediction of rainfall indices with higher lead time was also found excellent. The synoptic pattern revealed that SLP over the north of South China Sea is the major driver of NEM rainfall and rainfall extremes in Peninsular Malaysia.},

   abstract = {Purely empirical and numerical methods are widely used in landslide movement prediction because they can forecast the failure time and consider influence factors, respectively. However, the combination of these two methods for prediction is rare. This paper develops an integrated landslide movement prediction model that can fully consider landslide kinematics and external influence factors using the Verhulst inverse function (VIF) and the random forest (RF) algorithm. The VIF is applied to describe the kinematic behavior of landslides using the rationale of three-stage creep deformation. The RF algorithm is to quantify the response of landslide displacement to the influence of external factors such as reservoir water level and rainfall intensities. The novelty of the VIF-RF model is illustrated by applying to a reservoir landslide, Gapa Landslide, in Southwestern China. The results show that the VIF-RF model shows significant improvement in predicting landslide movement compared with the VIF or RF model. The error analysis confirms that the root mean square error of the VIF-RF decreases by more than 20% compared with the VIF and RF models. In addition, the mean absolute percentage error of the VIF-RF models is less than 5%, a decrease by 2.3% and 10.1% compared to the VIF and RF models, respectively. The feasibility of the VIF-RF model for predicting movement of other reservoir landslides was successfully verified by the Majiagou landslide in the TGRA. The developed VIF-RF model indicates the Gapa landslide deformation is at the primary stage over the monitoring period. The displacement at the G1 and G2 monitoring locations of the Gapa landslide is projected to increase to 2719.8 and 2438.8 mm in January 2021, respectively, and the average rate in the accelerated deformation periods is projected to be 67.8 mm/month. The presented VIF-RF model provides an effective approach for predicting the long-term landslide deformation and identifying its deformation stage.},

   abstract = {Flood forecasting can provide accurate inferences and early warnings for flood control work during the flood season. Due to the variability of local rainfall and the complexity of geographic conditions, existing prediction methods were unable to accurately predict the flooding process in a particular basin. Additionally, the water level sensor generates a significant amount of noise in the inbound flow data during period measurement. To address these issues, this article proposes a real-time flood forecasting model, which is used to accurately predict flood trends and peak times in the flood period. The model uses a convolution kernel function to smooth out local noise and neighborhood values, minimizing the impact of non-stationary series on the training process while retaining the true evolution of the flood in the original data. In our model, we develop a time series attention mechanism that is used to apply various weights to time series input vectors, such as outflow flow and rainfall from upstream reservoirs, this mechanism also improves the accuracy of short-term series prediction. To obtain additional information about the output of the recurrent neural network layer, we also include a multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average module. This method can add a linear component to the output, allowing the prediction result to adapt to the input period's scale shift. This article develops matching models for interval and full basin floods based on the geographical characteristics of China's urban Reservoir and the river basin, thresholds are established based on the outflow from upstream reservoirs, which enables the flood forecasting system to dynamically adjust model parameters in response to the threshold, it also circumvents the scaling problem inherent in flood time series at various scales. We trained and predicted using 25 different types of floods in Ankang Reservoir from 2010 to 2020. Three on-site real-time forecasts of catastrophic flooding at the Ankang Reservoir were conducted in September 2021 to validate the model's accuracy. The algorithm's efficiency in forecasting flood inflows is demonstrated through comparisons to traditional hydrological models and other machine learning networks, and our model consistently forecasts the peak time and total flood volume with the least amount of error in the comparison algorithm.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Weather is a pivotal factor for crop production as it is highly volatile and can hardly be controlled by farm management practices. Since there is a tendency towards increased weather extremes in the future, understanding weather-related yield factors becomes increasingly important not only for yield prediction, but also for the design of insurance products. Although insurance products mitigate financial losses for farmers, they suffer from considerable basis risk, i.e., a discrepancy between losses and the indemnity payment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to explore the potential of machine learning for estimating the relationship between crop yield and weather conditions at the farm level and to use it as a tool for reducing basis risk in index insurance applications. METHODS: An artificial neural network was set up and calibrated to a rich set of farm-level yield data in Germany, covering the period from 2003 to 2018. A nonlinear regression model, which uses rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture as explanatory variables for yield deviations, served as a benchmark. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The empirical application revealed that compared with traditional estimation approaches, the gain in forecasting precision by using machine learning techniques was substantial. Moreover, the use of regionalized models and disaggregated high-resolution weather data improved the performance of artificial neural networks. A considerable part of yield variability at the farm level, however, could not be captured by statistical methods which solely use “big weather data”. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings have important implications for the design of weather-index based insurance because they document that a rather high level of basis risk remains if insurance products are based on an estimation of the weather-yield relationship.},

   abstract = {Long-term forecasting of any hydrologic phenomena is essential for strategic environmental planning, hydrologic and other forms of structural design, agriculture, and water resources management. Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gauging stations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE ≈1.30% and RMAE ≈ 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.},

However, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models provide precipitation forecasts with bias. This study proposed to combine support vector machine (SVM) regression with quantile-based bias correction method to improve real-time 39-hour precipitation forecasts in Japan. Five methods were compared and evaluated against observations, which include SVM regression, quantile mapping (QM), cumulative distribution function transform (CDFt), and the combination of SVM and QM (or CDFt). Results indicated that the combination of SVM and CDFt (i.e., SVM-CDFt) generally provided the highest accuracy with good computational efficiency. SVM alone improved the spatial representation of hourly precipitation with a correlation coefficient increased from 0.387 to 0.490 in January and from 0.235 to 0.296 in July in the cross-validation experiment. However, SVM underestimated the variability of hourly precipitation and heavy precipitation events. QM and CDFt perform well in correcting the bias in modeled precipitation, while they have limited capability in correcting the rainband location. Combining SVM and quantile-based method took advantage of both approaches, providing a more consistent variability with observations and better predicted extreme precipitation events, although overestimation of rainfall area was witnessed. The simple concept, high computational efficiency, as well as evident improvement in forecast accuracy make the combined cases, especially the SVM-CDFt method, beneficial for real-time precipitation forecast and flood early warning.},

An effective monitoring and forecasting system is needed to assess the extent of droughts and to mitigate their effects at both spatial and temporal levels. To this end, we used a Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in various timescales to classify and track drought events based on CHIRPS rainfall data for the period between 1981 and 2019. Three models (M1, M2, M3) were then tested for annual drought prediction (SPI_12) using precipitation data and the lagged SPI as input variables. Extreme Learning Machine algorithms displayed rapid drought prediction, with high accuracy on different timescales (0.7–0.8 R2).},

   abstract = {Forest fire disaster is currently the subject of intense research worldwide. The development of accurate strategies to prevent potential impacts and minimize the occurrence of disastrous events as much as possible requires modeling and forecasting severe conditions. In this study, we developed five new hybrid machine learning algorithms namely, Frequency Ratio-Multilayer Perceptron (FR-MLP), Frequency Ratio-Logistic Regression (FR-LR), Frequency Ratio-Classification and Regression Tree (FR-CART), Frequency Ratio-Support Vector Machine (FR-SVM), and Frequency Ratio-Random Forest (FR-RF), for mapping forest fire susceptibility in the north of Morocco. To this end, a total of 510 points of historic forest fires as the forest fire inventory map and 10 independent causal factors including elevation, slope, aspect, distance to roads, distance to residential areas, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature, and wind speed were used. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) was computed to assess the effectiveness of the models. The results of conducting proposed models indicated that RF-FR achieved the highest performance (AUC = 0.989), followed by SVM-FR (AUC = 0.959), MLP-FR (AUC = 0.858), CART-FR (AUC = 0.847), LR-FR (AUC = 0.809) in the forecasting of the forest fire. The outcome of this research as a prediction map of forest fire risk areas can provide crucial support for the management of Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Moreover, the results demonstrate that these novel developed hybrid models can increase the accuracy and performance of forest fire susceptibility studies and the approach can be applied to other areas.},

An erratic rainfall distribution in the country affects the agriculture on which the economy of the country depends on. Wise use of rainfall water should be planned and practiced in the country to minimize the problem of the drought and flood occurred in the country. The main objective of this study is to identify the relevant atmospheric features that cause rainfall and predict the intensity of daily rainfall using machine learning techniques. The Pearson correlation technique was used to select relevant environmental variables which were used as an input for the machine learning model. The dataset was collected from the local meteorological office at Bahir Dar City, Ethiopia to measure the performance of three machine learning techniques (Multivariate Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boost). Root mean squared error and Mean absolute Error methods were used to measure the performance of the machine learning model.

   abstract = {Groundwater footprint index (GFI) is an essential indicator to assess the sustainability of groundwater aquifers. Prediction of future GFI can significantly help managers and decision-makers of groundwater supply to better plan for future resilient consumption of surface and groundwater. In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning models can aid to predict GFI in view of lacking or uncertain data. We used this technique to predict GFI for 178 Iranian aquifers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that GFI was predicted using machine learning models. Four models, i.e., adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, least-squares support vector regression, random forest, and gene expression programming, were used to predict GFI. Systematic combinations of eight variables, including precipitation, recharge, return water, infiltration from the river to the aquifer, groundwater exploitation, aquifer area, evaporation, and river drainage from the aquifer were used in the form of nine input scenarios for GFI prediction. The results showed that inclusion of all input variables gave the best results for predicting the GFI. Predicted GFIs were generally between 0.5 and 8 with an average of 1.9. A value above 1 indicates that groundwater consumption is not resilient that can adversely affect available groundwater resources in the future. Over-use of groundwater can lead to land subsidence. Especially, aquifers located in Qom, Qazvin, Varamin, and Hamedan provinces of Iran may be affected due to large over-use. Among the four models, least-squares support vector regression resulted in the highest prediction performance. Due to the poor performance of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, the novel Harris hawks optimization algorithm was used to improve the performance of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. The Harris hawks optimization - adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system hybrid model improved the GFI prediction performance. Machine learning methods improve prediction of GFI for aquifers and thus, can be used to better manage groundwater in areas with less reliable data.},

This paper explores the importance of those additional climatic variables other than temperature and precipitation. Using the county-level agricultural data from 1980 to 2010 in China, we find that those additional climatic variables, especially humidity and wind speed, are critical for crop growth. Therefore, omitting those variables is likely to bias the predicted impacts of climate change on crop yields. In particular, omitting humidity tends to overpredict the cost of climate change on crop yields, while ignoring wind speed is likely to underpredict the effect. Our preferred specification indicates that climate change is likely to decrease the yields of rice, wheat, and corn in China by 36.25%, 18.26%, and 45.10%, respectively, by the end of this century.},

Forecasts at daily and seasonal scale are vital for early warning, estimation of event frequency for hydraulic design, and long-term projections for developing adaptation strategies to future conditions. All three types of predictions—forecasts, frequency estimates, and projections—typically treat droughts and floods independently, even though both types of extremes can be studied using related approaches and have similar challenges. In this review, we (a) identify challenges common to drought and flood prediction and their joint assessment and (b) discuss tractable approaches to tackle these challenges. We group challenges related to flood and drought prediction into four interrelated categories: data, process understanding, modeling and prediction, and human–water interactions. Data-related challenges include data availability and event definition. Process-related challenges include the multivariate and spatial characteristics of extremes, non-stationarities, and future changes in extremes. Modeling challenges arise in frequency analysis, stochastic, hydrological, earth system, and hydraulic modeling. Challenges with respect to human–water interactions lie in establishing links to impacts, representing human–water interactions, and science communication. We discuss potential ways of tackling these challenges including exploiting new data sources, studying droughts and floods in a joint framework, studying societal influences and compounding drivers, developing continuous stochastic models or non-stationary models, and obtaining stakeholder feedback. Tackling one or several of these challenges will improve flood and drought predictions and help to minimize the negative impacts of extreme events.

This study is the first to assess potential changes in health risk from droughts during the last decade in the contiguous United States. To assess the risk, we spatially superimposed vulnerability variables associated with drought on historical drought exposure over the last decade. Different variations in Local Moran’s I statistics were used to assess the spatial distribution of health vulnerability, risk of drought, and changes in the two five-year study periods (2010–2014 and 2015–2019). Our results show large clusters of the western United States had a significant increase in risk during the latter part of the study period due to increases in vulnerability and hazard. In addition, southern areas of the United States were consistently above the national average in drought risk. Since our vulnerability variables include agriculture, drinking water, and sociodemographic indicators, the results of this study can help various experts interested in drought preparedness efforts associated with human health.},

   abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential ecohydrological process linking the land surface energy, water and carbon cycles, and plays a critical role in the earth system. ET remains one of the most problematic components of the water cycle to be determined due to the heterogeneity of the landscape and the complexity of driving factors. The satellite-based earth observation is expected to provide ET information at large-scales. However, accurate global ET information, with spatially and temporally continuous coverage at moderate-to-high resolution, is still scarce. In this paper, a combined model, called ETMonitor, with multi-process parameterizations, was improved and applied to estimate the global ET, mainly using the biophysical and hydrological parameters/variables retrieved from satellite observations. The ETMonitor model was improved in several aspects in this study to generate the global ET datasets during 2000–2019 at daily/1-km resolution, including: 1) adopting high temporal resolution surface water cover and snow/ice cover as input, to simulate the impact of their seasonal change on ET variation; 2) parameterizing the impact of soil moisture on plant transpiration and soil evaporation using high resolution soil moisture, which was downscaled to 1-km resolution from the coarse resolution data retrieved from microwave remote sensing observation; 3) involving a better soil heat flux estimation to reduce its impact on the uncertainty of estimated ET; 4) being calibrated based on global ground flux observations to achieve better accuracy. The estimated daily ET was validated based on the global in situ observations at site scale across various ecosystems, with overall high correlation (0.75), low bias (0.08 mm d-1), and low root mean square error (0.93 mm d-1). It had good ability to partition total ET to plant transpiration and soil evaporation indicated by the good agreement with the ground isotope measurements in a growing season at one site in the northwest China. The estimated global ET was cross-validated by comparing with other existing ET products, and it showed the global ET estimated by ETMonitor could capture the expected global ET patterns both in space and in time. It also indicated the superiority of the ET product by ETMonitor in the following aspects: capability in capturing the seasonal dynamics of waterbody evaporation and sublimation; better performance in capturing the spatial variation of ET in the irrigated cropland regions and mountain regions with complex terrain than other global ET products, e.g., the GLEAM and MOD16 ET products; capability of ET component partitioning at high spatial (1-km) and high temporal (daily) resolutions with good accuracy. The estimated plant transpiration, soil evaporation, canopy rainfall interception loss, and water body evaporation and snow sublimation accounted for 61.54 % (±0.44 %), 19.08 % (±0.54 %), 13.54 % (±0.49 %), and 5.84 % (±0.24 %), respectively, of the total ET on global average. The ETMonitor global ET dataset could provide important information on studies of global terrestrial water and energy cycles and climate change studies, and water resources management at global and regional scales.},

Climate warming is projected to intensify tundra wildfire, with profound implications for permafrost thaw. A major uncertainty is how increased burning will interact with climate change to exacerbate thermokarst (ground-surface collapse resulting from permafrost thaw). Here we show that thermokarst rates increased by ∼60% with warming climate and wildfire from 1950 to 2015 in Arctic Alaska. Wildfire amplified thermokarst over 40+ years, cumulatively creating ∼9 times thermokarst formation as that in unburned tundra. However, thermokarst triggered by repeat burns did not differ from that triggered by single burns, irrespective of time between fires. Our simulation identified climate change as the principal driver of all thermokarst formed during 1950–2015 (4,700 km2) in Arctic Alaska, but wildfire was disproportionately responsible for 10.5% of the thermokarst by burning merely 3.4% of the landscape. These results combined suggest that climate change and wildfire will synergistically accelerate thermokarst as the Arctic transitions in this century.},

   abstract = {Total soil CO2 efflux (FCO2) is the second most important carbon flux after photosynthesis in boreal forests. However, accurate modelling of FCO2 remains challenging because of its high variability, both temporally and spatially. Using an Abies balsamea-dominated boreal landscape in Quebec (eastern Canada) as a case study, we modelled seasonal, intra-seasonal and spatial variability of FCO2 using climate variables and topographic and canopy structure attributes derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and assessed their respective contributions to soil CO2 emissions. Weekly point measurements of FCO2 at 99 sites were taken over an area of 122 ha between June and October 2020. The seasonal component of FCO2 was quantified and subtracted from FCO2 measurements to isolate the spatial and intra-seasonal components of the flux. The two components were then modelled using a Random Forest Regression model and studied using accumulated local effect plots (ALE plots). Our approach explained 81% of the variation in FCO2: the seasonal pattern explained 36% of the variation in FCO2 measurements, while spatial and intra-seasonal patterns together explained 45%. The most important factors explaining spatial variation were vegetation height and the slope height. Average air temperature of the last two days before efflux measurements was the most important factor explaining intra-seasonal variation. The proposed methodology makes it possible to predict FCO2 from external factors derived from climate and remote sensing data and enables the decomposition of FCO2 into its seasonal, intra-seasonal and spatial components. Our results demonstrate the importance of spatial and intra-seasonal variations in FCO2 compared to seasonal variation, a finding that has implications for the measurement and modelling of FCO2 at landscape and global scales.},

The numerous processes implicated in the rapid and profound climate-driven changes that are underway across the world's mountains must be well monitored, understood, and—as far as possible—accurately projected. However, not only are the available environmental data upon which such activities hinge often severely limited, but interdisciplinary consensus regarding which variables should be considered observation priorities also remains elusive. Here, the concept of Essential Mountain Climate Variables (EMCVs) is introduced as a potential means of ameliorating the situation. After a review of climate-driven environmental change in mountains, a preliminary set of corresponding EMCVs is proposed. Variables pertaining to several disciplines naturally feature prominently. In addition, several are not currently considered to hold broader global relevance, which justifies our mountain-specific approach. Established and emerging possibilities to measure, generate, and apply EMCVs are then summarized. Finally, future activities toward the concept’s formalization are recommended. Ultimately, the approach hopes to increase the utility of mountainous environmental data to both fundamental science and decision making related to environmental management, risk mitigation, and adaptation.},

   abstract = {Leptospirosis is a neglected waterborne zoonosis of growing concern in tropical and low-income regions. Endemic in Southeast Asia, its distribution and environmental factors such as climate controlling its dynamics remain poorly documented. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the current and future leptospirosis burden at a local scale in mainland Southeast Asia. We adjusted machine-learning models on incidence reports from the Thai surveillance system to identify environmental determinants of leptospirosis. The explanatory variables tested in our models included climate, topographic, land cover and soil variables. The model performing the best in cross-validation was used to estimate the current incidence regionally in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. It then allowed to predict the spatial distribution of leptospirosis future burden from 2021 to 2100 based on an ensemble of CMIP6 climate model projections and 4 Shared Socio-economics Pathways ranging from the most optimistic to the no-climate policy outcomes (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0 and SSP5–8.5). Leptospirosis incidence was best estimated by 10 environmental variables: four landscape-, four rainfall-, two temperature-related variables. Of all tested scenario, the worst-case scenario of climate change (SSP5–8.5) surprisingly appeared as the best-case scenario for the future of leptospirosis since it would induce a significant global decline in disease incidence in Southeast Asia mainly driven by the increasing temperatures. These global patterns are however contrasted regionally with some regions showing increased incidence in the future. Our work highlights climate and the environment as major drivers of leptospirosis incidence in Southeast Asia. Applying our model to regions where leptospirosis is not routinely monitored suggests an overlooked burden in the region. As our model focuses on leptospirosis responses to environmental drivers only, some other factors, such as poverty, lifestyle or behavioral changes, could further influence these estimated future patterns.},

   abstract = {Soil moisture deficiency is a major factor in determining crop yields in water-limited agricultural production regions. Evapotranspiration (ET), which consists of crop water use through transpiration and water loss through direct soil evaporation, is a good indicator of soil moisture availability and vegetation health. ET therefore has been an integral part of many yield estimation efforts. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) is an ET-based crop stress indicator that describes temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration metric as derived from satellite remote sensing. ESI has demonstrated the capacity to explain regional yield variability in water-limited regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to interannual phenological variability. This investigation selected three study sites across the U.S. Corn Belt – Mead, NE, Ames, IA and Champaign, IL – to investigate the potential operational value of 30-m resolution, phenologically corrected ESI datasets for yield prediction. The analysis was conducted over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017, which included both drought and pluvial conditions as well as a broad range in yield values. Detrended yield anomalies for corn and soybean were correlated with ESI computed using annual ET curves temporally aligned based on (1) calendar date, (2) crop emergence date, and (3) a growing degree day (GDD) scaled time axis. Results showed that ESI has good correlations with yield anomalies at the county scale and that phenological corrections to the annual temporal alignment of the ET timeseries improve the correlation, especially when the time axis is defined by GDD rather than the calendar date. Peak correlations occur in the silking stage for corn and the reproductive stage for soybean – phases when these crops are particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. Regression equations derived at the time of peak correlation were used to estimate yields at county scale using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The ESI-based yield estimates agree well with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) county-level crop yield data, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and percent root-mean-square errors of 5–8%. These results demonstrate that remotely sensed ET at high spatiotemporal resolution can convey valuable water stress information for forecasting crop yields across the Corn Belt if interannual phenological variability is considered.},

   abstract = {Snow cover is highly critical for global water and energy cycles because of its wide areal extent, high reflectivity and good thermal insulation. Knowledge of snow conditions, e.g., snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth, is significant to hydrologic and climatologic processes. Spaceborne passive microwave (PMW) data, namely, brightness temperature (TB), have been in use for snow depth and SWE retrieval at the global scale since 1978. However, the sensitivity of TB to these parameters is complex due to snow metamorphism (e.g., snow grain size, GS), which limits the feasibility of many existing algorithms characterizing snow. This study presents a new methodology to retrieve snow depth over China by coupling a microwave snow emission model with a random forest (RF) machine learning (ML) technique. An effective GS value (effGS), a prior snowpack descriptor, was optimized utilizing the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) model by minimizing the difference between AMSR2 observations (18.7 and 36.5 GHz) and HUT simulations. Five elaborately selected independent variables, including vertical polarized TB differences (TBD) between 18.7 and 36.5 GHz (TBD18.7V&36.5V), 10.65 and 36.5 GHz (TBD10.65V&36.5V), longitude, elevation and effGS, together with the target variable, snow depth, were applied to train the RF model, and then the 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) approach was employed for performance validation using station data during the period from 2012 to 2018. The results indicated that (1) inclusion of effGS in RF greatly enhanced the overall performance in snow depth estimation; (2) the trained RF model performed better on a temporal scale than on a spatial scale, with unRMSEs of 1.81 cm and 3.17 cm, respectively; (3) specifically, the fitted RF algorithm partially addressed the overestimation in shallow (≤ 20 cm) snowpacks and underestimation in deep (> 20 cm) snow conditions when compared with the established RF algorithm based solely on predictor variables but without effGS. To evaluate the predictive power of the RF algorithm trained with samples in 2017 and 2018, spatially independent station measurements during the period from 2012 to 2016 and field survey data collected from January 2018 to March 2019 were used for validation. Additionally, the RF estimates were compared with two widely used satellite products (AMSR2 and GlobSnow-2). The validation results showed that RF estimates were closer to the in situ data than the other two satellite products. This study demonstrated the potential utility of combining the snow emission model with an ML approach to improve snow depth estimation.},

Although prior researches have showed that 2D/3D architectural pattern can significantly affect LST, the comprehensive effect of 2D/3D architectural pattern on thermal environment is still controversial and obscure due to the impact of architectural pattern on LST would vary under different observational scales and seasons, making it necessary to examine the temporal variation and scale-dependent of the relationship between them. This study takes Hangzhou as a study area to probe the relationship between seasonal LST and 2D/3D building metrics across ten analytical scales. Major findings include: (1) From spring to winter, the spatial dependency of LST becomes weaker with the increasing observational scale. (2) The regression analysis results show that the mean architecture projection area (MAPA), building coverage ratio (BCR), floor area ratio (FAR) and mean architecture height (MAH) are the most dominant metrics, with the range of average relative contributions are 10.96–16.68%, 14.61–45.20%, 7.90–17.05% and 5.80–14.23% in four seasons. Moreover, the relative contributions of chosen metrics on seasonal LST exhibit consistency in spring, summer and autumn. (3) The marginal effect analysis results reveal that the threshold values of these four dominant metrics are sensitive to analytical scale and would reduce with the analytical unit increases in four seasons. These findings indicate that controlling the building density, building height and floor area ratio of built-up areas in a reasonable range according to the spatial scale of planning unit, advocating more dispersed arrangement of the buildings and smaller architectural base area in Hangzhou can be favorable in ameliorating thermal environment.},

   abstract = {In Ecuador, there is a limitation on air quality monitoring due to the cost of monitoring networks. Although air quality monitoring stations are instruments for air measurement, they do not cover an entire city due to their scope. Satellite remote sensing is now an effective tool to study atmospheric pollutants and has been applied to continuously assess a region and overcome the limitations of fixed stations. Despite the application of satellite data for air quality monitoring, there are some limitations, such as measurement frequency, cloud cover and wide spatial resolution, which do not allow the assessment of air pollution in cities. Therefore, downscaling, applying interpolation methods, is essential for continuous air quality monitoring at smaller scales. For this research, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) data from the Sentinel-5 satellite percussor was used in the city of Guayaquil for January–December 2020, which is considered before, during and after the COVID-19 quarantine. This mid-size port city does not have a permanent monitoring network, which prevents us from knowing the air quality. Due to the limitation of pixel size, this study used satellite data to apply interpolation techniques and reduce pixels to assess air quality. Two categories of interpolation were selected: deterministic and stochastic. The empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) interpolation obtained a R2 of 0.9546, which was superior to the other methods applied. Therefore, the EBK method had the best accuracy for tropospheric NO2 concentration. Finally, the method used in this research can help monitor air quality in cities lacking continuous monitoring networks, as the reduction of the pixel size gives us a better pattern of pollutants.},

   abstract = {Fossil pollen records are well-established indicators of past vegetation changes. The prevalence of pollen across environmental settings including lakes, wetlands, and marine sediments, has made palynology one of the most ubiquitous and valuable tools for studying past environmental and climatic change globally for decades. A complementary research focus has been the development of statistical techniques to derive quantitative estimates of climatic conditions from pollen assemblages. This paper reviews the most commonly used statistical techniques and their rationale and seeks to provide a resource to facilitate their inclusion in more palaeoclimatic research. To this end, we first address the fundamental aspects of fossil pollen data that should be considered when undertaking pollen-based climate reconstructions. We then introduce the range of techniques currently available, the history of their development, and the situations in which they can be best employed. We review the literature on how to define robust calibration datasets, produce high-quality reconstructions, and evaluate climate reconstructions, and suggest methods and products that could be developed to facilitate accessibility and global usability. To continue to foster the development and inclusion of pollen climate reconstruction methods, we promote the development of reporting standards. When established, such standards should 1) enable broader application of climate reconstruction techniques, especially in regions where such methods are currently underused, and 2) enable the evaluation and reproduction of individual reconstructions, structuring them for the evolving open-science era, and optimising the use of fossil pollen data as a vital means for the study of past environmental and climatic variability. We also strongly encourage developers and users of palaeoclimate reconstruction methodologies to make associated programming code publicly available, which will further help disseminate these techniques to interested communities.},

Because of the effort to ensure the sustainable use of soil resources, demand for current, updatable soil information capable of supporting decisions across scales is increasing. Digital soil mapping (DSM) addresses the drawbacks of conventional soil mapping and has been increasingly used for delivering soil information in a time- and cost-efficient manner with higher spatial resolution, better map accuracy, and quantified uncertainty estimates. We reviewed 244 articles published between January 2003 and July 2021 and then summarised the progress in broad-scale (spatial extent >10,000 km2) DSM, focusing on the 12 mandatory soil properties for GlobalSoilMap. We observed that DSM publications continued to increase exponentially; however, the majority (74.6%) focused on applications rather than methodology development. China, France, Australia, and the United States were the most active countries, and Africa and South America lacked country-based DSM products. Approximately 78% of articles focused on mapping soil organic matter/carbon content and soil organic carbon stocks because of their significant role in food security and climate regulation. Half the articles focused on soil information in topsoil only (<30 cm), and studies on deep soil (100–200 cm) were less represented (21.7%). Relief, organisms, and climate were the three most frequently used environmental covariates in DSM. Nonlinear models (i.e. machine learning) have been increasingly used in DSM for their capacity to manage complex interactions between soil information and environmental covariates. Soil pH was the best predicted soil property (average R2 of 0.60, 0.63, and 0.56 at 0–30, 30–100, and 100–200 cm). Other relatively well-predicted soil properties were clay, silt, sand, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic matter (SOM), SOC stocks, and bulk density, and coarse fragments and soil depth were poorly predicted (R2 < 0.28). In addition, decreasing model performance with deeper depth intervals was found for most soil properties. Further research should pursue rescuing legacy data, sampling new data guided by well-designed sampling schemas, collecting representative environmental covariates, improving the performance and interpretability of advanced spatial predictive models, relating performance indicators such as accuracy and precision to cost-benefit and risk assessment analysis for improving decision support; moving from static DSM to dynamic DSM; and providing high-quality, fine-resolution digital soil maps to address global challenges related to soil resources.},

This study focuses on three wine-growing regions in northern Portugal: Vinho Verde, Trás-os-Montes and Douro, the latter coinciding with Porto. High rainfall during late spring (April to June) can promote growth of the vines but increases the risk of fungal disease. High rainfall during harvest time (August to October) also bears the potential for severe operational disruption and heavy economic losses. The probability of unprecedented rainfall totals in spring and the harvest season over wine-growing regions of northern Portugal has been assessed. A large ensemble of initialised climate model simulations is analysed, and the probability of unprecedented rainfall in each season is quantified. Seasonal rainfall totals considerably higher than any observed are possible in the current climate. An unprecedented rainfall event in either season could occur with a probability between 0.01 and 0.05 in the present climate. Extreme value analysis was applied to rainfall totals from observations and the model ensemble, and the return periods of known extreme rainfall events are calculated. Similar probabilities for unprecedented rainfall totals were calculated. A year similar to 1993, when both seasons were exceptionally wet, would be expected to occur, on average, just once in the next 70–80 years in the current climate. These results could inform the requirements for improved vineyard management and resilience, such as design of drainage channels, access roads and terraces.},

Most existing flux products of terrestrial carbon, water and energy components were developed individually, despite the inherently coupled processes among them. In this study, we present a new set of global daily surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SW), net radiation (Rnet), evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) datasets at 0.05° resolutions from 1982 to 2019, by improving a satellite-based and coupled-process model—the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). The new version of BESS (v2.0) integrated a newly developed ecosystem respiration module, an optimality-based maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) model, and extended the temporal coverage of flux datasets from 1982 to 2019. We evaluated BESS products against the FLUXNET2015 dataset at the site scale, and against several remote sensing and/or machine learning products on a global scale. At the site scale, BESS products agreed well with FLUXNET measurements, capturing 84%, 53%, 65%, 51% and 31% of daily variation in Rnet, ET, GPP, TER and NEE, respectively. Interannual variation in BESS NEE showed relatively low consistency with the FLUXNET measurements, while the rest fluxes explained approximately half of the interannual variation. On a global scale, we found marked discrepancies in spatio-temporal patterns between BESS and several benchmark products. Over the period 1982–2019, BESSv2.0 estimated the mean annual global Rnet, ET, GPP, TER and NEE to be 340.97 ± 5.22 ZJ yr−1 (mean ± 1 SD), 67.67 ± 0.71 103 km3 yr−1, 125.74 ± 5.95 Pg C yr−1, 109.30 ± 3.16 Pg C yr−1, and − 16.28 ± 2.95 Pg C yr−1, respectively, with significant annual linear trends (P < 0.01) by −0.05 103 km3 yr−2 for ET, by 0.52 Pg C yr−2 for GPP, by 0.28 Pg C yr−2 for TER, and by −0.25 Pg C yr−2 for NEE. We further evaluated various coupled processes derived by BESS in terms of functional properties (i.e., Budyko relation, carbon-use efficiency, water-use efficiency, and light-use efficiency), which agreed well with FLUXNET observations, unlike the benchmark products. Overall, BESSv2.0 can serve as a set of reliable and independent products from other global satellite products, facilitating studies related to global carbon, water and energy budgets in a coupled and comprehensive manner.},

To facilitate further research and development in this area, this paper provides a review of deep learning-based solar and wind energy forecasting research published during the last five years discussing extensively the data and datasets used in the reviewed works, the data pre-processing methods, deterministic and probabilistic methods, and evaluation and comparison methods. The core characteristics of all the reviewed works are summarised in tabular forms to enable methodological comparisons. The current challenges in the field and future research directions are given. The trends show that hybrid forecasting models are the most used in this field followed by Recurrent Neural Network models including Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit, and in the third place Convolutional Neural Networks. We also find that probabilistic and multistep ahead forecasting methods are gaining more attention.

A multivariate pattern analysis, based on Empirical Orthogonal Functions applied to monthly time series, reveals strong coupling of changes across several biophysical variables and the global forcing itself, on both yearly and multidecadal time scales. Rising air and ocean temperatures from the global models are strongly coupled with rising regional temperatures and reduced ice cover/thickness, as well as strong changes to the phenology of the plankton food chain, including reduced biomass of large zooplankton in the fall. This method ultimately provides a compact way to estimate the changes to many regional attributes under a variety of global change scenarios. Application of this method to a broad ensemble of the CMIP6 global model air temperatures suggests that compared to present conditions, the Bering Sea shelf bottom temperatures in July will warm by an average of ∼4 degrees C by the end of the 21st century under SSP585, as compared with ∼1 degrees C under SSP126, with greatest warming focused on the outer northern shelf.},

   abstract = {Plastic greenhouses (PGs), as safeguard agricultural facilities, have changed the cultivation structure of agriculture, to a certain extent, and can seriously impact the environment. Exploring the temporal characteristics of greenhouses in terms of quantity and area is significant for sustainable agricultural development and environmental protection. Pixel or object-based large-scale greenhouse mapping has difficulty meeting the demand for the simultaneous extraction of greenhouse quantity and area. Multibranch task model can provide the number and area information of greenhouse. However, there are various labeling methods and model between different branches, which lead to the deviation between quantity and area results. This paper proposes a model that is based on improved you only look once X (YOLOX) and kullback–leibler divergence (KLD), called YOLOX and KLD plus (YXLD + ), to obtain spatiotemporally consistent greenhouse mapping. The new model still has stable performance in dense scenes, with a 5.7 % improvement in average precision compared to BBAVectors. Finally, a multitemporal greenhouse map of Zhoukou City was obtained using imagery provided by Google Earth (GE). Overall, the distribution of greenhouses in Zhoukou City remained stable between 2012 and 2017. However, the number and area of greenhouses in local areas has increased rapidly in the past five years, with the number of greenhouses increasing by 47.08 % and the area expanding by 41.38 %. Greenhouses' distribution and changing characteristics concentrate on the gently sloping areas from the northwest to the southeast. These results provide an objective perspective on the development of the local agricultural cultivation structure, which is of significant importance for the promotion of agricultural modernization.},

   abstract = {Modeling approaches are useful tools for assessing the general state of eutrophication and understanding the effects of multiple stressors on coastal ecosystems. Thus, we hypothesized that anthropogenic pressures and multiple stressors would increase the trophic state of macrotidal estuaries. Datasets from long-term (2012−2020) environmental and biological monitoring in the Itapecuru River estuary (IRE) were analyzed using the pressure-state-response (PSR) approach and nonlinear methods. Our results indicated a low dilution of nutrients and a moderate flushing potential of urban effluent (2150.94 ton year−1) in the estuary. The estuary was consequently classified as being in a high trophic state, being susceptible to and suffering high estuarine pressure to develop eutrophic symptoms. The Assessment of estuarine trophic status (ASSETS) model indicates that eutrophication is seasonal and depends on climatic variation. La Niña events (2019–2020) contributed to chlorophyll-a (>40 μg L−1) and orthophosphate (0.04 mg L−1) concentrations, principally during periods of low river discharge. According to the GAM's model, brackish waters (salinity>10) with high temperatures (> 30 °C) and high dissolved oxygen (>4 mg L−1) have more intense trophic conditions, especially in the mixing zone. The low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (DO<3 mg L−1) and high concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the seawater zone indicate that the lower portion of the estuary was the most susceptible. In addition, the random forest model selected salinity, DIP and Chl-a as the principal stressors that intensified eutrophication in the macrotidal systems. According to the ASSETS final ranking (worsen-high) for the next decade (2021−2031), the primary planned strategies should be to reduce anthropogenic contributions and improve trophic conditions in the IRE. From these results, the interactions and predictions of eco-hydrological effects could facilitate the characterization of future risks and the management of macrotidal estuarine systems.},

Sacramento San Joaquin River Basin, California
Study focus
The study forecasts the streamflow at a regional scale within SSJ river basin with largescale climate variables. The proposed approach eliminates the bias resulting from predefined indices at regional scale. The study was performed for eight unimpaired streamflow stations from 1962–2016. First, the Singular Valued Decomposition (SVD) teleconnections of the streamflow corresponding to 500 mbar geopotential height, sea surface temperature, 500 mbar specific humidity (SHUM500), and 500 mbar U-wind (U500) were obtained. Second, the skillful SVD teleconnections were screened non-parametrically. Finally, the screened teleconnections were used as the streamflow predictors in the non-linear regression models (K-nearest neighbor regression and data-driven support vector machine).
New hydrological insights
The SVD results identified new spatial regions that have not been included in existing predefined indices. The nonparametric model indicated the teleconnections of SHUM500 and U500 being better streamflow predictors compared to other climate variables. The regression models were capable to apprehend most of the sustained low flows, proving the model to be effective for drought-affected regions. It was also observed that the proposed approach showed better forecasting skills with preprocessed large scale climate variables rather than using the predefined indices. The proposed study is simple, yet robust in providing qualitative streamflow forecasts that may assist water managers in making policy-related decisions when planning and managing watersheds.},

   abstract = {Rainfall, temperature, and reference evapotranspiration (ET0) have a significant influence on irrigation, aridity, flooding, and crop water requirements. The primary aims of this study were to analyze the trends in rainfall, temperature, and ET0 in seven sub-climatic zones of Bangladesh from 1989 to 2020, as well as examine their interrelationships. The Modified Mann-Kendall method was employed to assess trends, while linear regression was used for trend validation. ET0 was calculated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method, and Sen’s slope was utilized to quantify the magnitude. Spatial analysis was conducted using Inverse Distance Weighting techniques. The findings revealed that annual rainfall increased only in the south-eastern zone, while the other zones experienced a decline. No significant changes were observed in annual maximum temperature, except in the south-eastern, north-eastern, and south-central zones, which showed variations ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 (°C/year). However, the yearly minimum temperature increased in all zones. Additionally, negative changes were observed in the annual magnitude of ET0 for all zones and seasons, except for the south-eastern and north-eastern zones, with a range of 0.01–0.02 mm/year. It was also noted that rainfall and ET0 displayed a strong decreasing relationship, except during the pre-monsoon season. Regarding regional variation, the northern regions exhibited a significant decreasing trend in both rainfall and ET0. The study identified key challenges, including water scarcity and irrigation difficulties due to declining rainfall and evapotranspiration, increased aridity, changing flood patterns, temperature-related impacts on crop growth, regional disparities in climate trends, and the need for effective climate change adaptation measures. Therefore, the study’s findings can contribute to knowledge in areas such as irrigation scheduling, promoting climate-smart agricultural practices, encouraging crop diversification to reduce dependence on water-intensive crops cultivation, and planning resilient water resource management to minimize the effects of environmental shifts, regulate human operations, and implement disaster remedial actions in Bangladesh.},

However, there remains a lack of a quantitative understanding on how LST differs from Ta within urban areas and what are the controlling factors of their interaction. We use crowdsourced air temperature measurements in Sydney, Australia, combined with urban landscape data, Local Climate Zones (LCZ), high-resolution satellite imagery, and machine learning to explore the interplay of urban form and fabric on the interaction between Ta and LST. Results show that LST and Ta have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics, and their relationship differs by season, ecological infrastructure, and building morphology. We found greater seasonal variability in LST compared to Ta, along with more pronounced intra-urban spatial variability in LST, particularly in warmer seasons. We also observed a greater temperature difference between LST and Ta in the built environment compared to the natural LCZs, especially during warm days. Natural LCZs (areas with mostly dense and scattered trees) showed stronger LST-Ta relationships compared to built areas. In particular, we observe that built areas with higher building density (where the heat vulnerability is likely more pronounced) show insignificant or negative relationships between LST- Ta in summer. Our results also indicate that surface cover, distance from the ocean, and seasonality significantly influence the distribution of hot and cold spots for LST and Ta. The spatial distribution for Ta hot spots does not always overlap with LST. We find that relying solely on LST as a direct proxy for the urban thermal environment is inappropriate, particularly in densely built-up areas and during warm seasons. These findings provide new perspectives on the relationship between surface and canopy temperatures and how these relate to urban form and fabric.},

Vegetation forecasting research has been accelerated using several deep learning (DL) algorithms through remote sensing (RS) data. In this context, we used artificial intelligence (AI) and the long-short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) method to explore and forecast future urban–rural vegetation disparities (ΔEVI, where EVI is the enhanced vegetation index) in Pakistan’s six megacities using MODIS EVI data. The forecast results revealed that ΔEVI is decreasing in all cities. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to evaluate LSTM-RNN. RSME values were recorded as 0.03, 0.07, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06 for Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, and Sialkot, respectively.

This situation indicates that LSTM-RNN can be used as a new reliable AI technique for forecasting. The results suggested that the average of forecasted ΔEVI for the next 10 years is −0.23, −0.21, −0.09, −0.13, −0.22, and −0.11 for Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, and Sialkot, respectively. The findings of this study will help evaluate the impact of urbanization on EVI by leveraging DL techniques along with implementing an urbanization policy for urban development and environmental protection for long-term urban sustainability.},

This was achieved by using historical and projected satellite datasets obtained from the ECMWF database. It was found that, compared to other technologies, poly-crystalline silicon (p-Si) technology yielded the highest increase in solar PV output compared to other modules in both best-case and moderate-case scenarios. However, in the worst-case scenario, amorphous silicon (a-Si) technology produces less than a 1% increase in solar PV production, while other technologies produce less than a 1% decrease in solar PV output. The CMIP6 climate model was also used to assess the effects of climate change on the region's global solar radiation. With the exception of the near- and far-future Boreal winter seasons (DJF), as the impact of climate change intensifies, there may be a corresponding decrease in solar radiation in the moderate- and worst-case scenarios in different seasons between 2015-2050 and 2051–2100, as well as in the annual resolution implying that solar energy should be the main contributor to renewable energy and low-carbon economic planning in the region. In addition, the authors used historical datasets to develop and test 171 theoretical models to estimate West Africa's solar radiation potential. According to the error metrics, the CARIMA-LG hybrid surpassed other models developed in this study as well as those obtained from the literature.},

Choushui River alluvial fan in central Taiwan.
Study focus
Excessive land subsidence is occurring in the Choushui alluvial fan, Taiwan. Groundwater pumping in the region is not monitored so pumping volumes are estimated from information based on electricity consumption. Groundwater pumping data alone cannot be used to accurately estimate the spatial rate and distribution of subsidence due to the low spatial correlation between estimated pumping volumes and subsidence from heterogeneous geologic materials. Time-dependent spatial regression is a reliable tool for estimating the spatial distribution of annual rate of subsidence based on spatial mapping of pumped groundwater volumes and monitored land subsidence.
New hydrological insights for the region
Estimates of pumping quantities indicate that the locations of subsidence from overexploitation of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system is not always spatially correlated with major pumping areas or with the observed locations of maximum water-level drawdown. Considering time-dependent spatial regression models, the average RMSE of annual subsidence is 0.65 cm for the Choushui alluvial fan, indicating the high level of correlation between measured and estimated subsidence. These findings show that annual subsidence can be reliably estimated and predicted under the field pumping conditions of the study site. The influences of reduced withdrawals based on the relation between annual subsidence and pumping volumes can be evaluated for improved best management practices.},

However, as soil data are produced using soil profiles and maps with multiple sources of uncertainty, wide discrepancies prevail in global soil datasets. Comparison of four commonly used soil datasets in Earth system climate models, i.e., Food and Agriculture Organization soil data, Harmonized World Soil Database, Global Soil Dataset for Earth System Model, and global gridded soil information system SoilGrids, yields widespread differences in southern Africa. This study investigates the simulated land-atmosphere interactions in southern Africa in the context of the uncertainties from applying different global soil datasets. We conducted ensemble simulations using the fully coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological Modeling system (WRF-Hydro) incorporated with each of the global soil datasets mentioned above. Model simulations were performed at 4-km convection-permitting scale from January 2015 to June 2016. By quantifying model's internal variability and comparing the modeling results, results show that the simulated temperature, soil moisture, and surface energy fluxes are largely impacted by soil texture differences. For instance, changes in soil texture and associated hydrophysical parameters result in large differences in air temperature up to 1.7°C and surface heat flux up to 25 W/m2, and disparities in averaged surface soil moisture differ up to 0.1 m3/m3 in austral summer months. Differences in soil texture characteristics also regulate local climatic conditions differently in the wet and dry seasons as well as in different climatic regions. Furthermore, the thermodynamic differences in surface energy fluxes caused by soil texture demonstrate physical feedback perspective on atmospheric processes, resulting in distinct changes in planetary boundary layer height. This study demonstrates the non-negligible impact of soil data on land surface-atmosphere coupled modeling and highlights the need for consistent consideration of modeling uncertainties from soil data in modeling applications.},

Reanalysis products (e.g., ERA-I, ERA5-land, JRA55, MERRA2) are the primary source data for the research about ROS events in the large-scale region. However, the accuracy and reliability of reanalyses have never been evaluated with respect to the determination of terrestrial ROS events. The present study aims to statistically evaluate the performance of reanalysis datasets in identifying ROS events with different criteria based on in-situ rainfall data and MODIS snow cover product. The results show that all reanalysis datasets exhibit poor performance (Recall ≤ 0.16, Kappa coefficient ≤ 0.26, F-score ≤ 0.42, MCC ≤ 0.33) in all criteria in the pan-Arctic, mainly due to the low accuracy of rainfall data (r ≤ 0.56). Nevertheless, the spatial distribution pattern and hot spots of ROS from all reanalysis datasets are essentially close. The hot spots of ROS are mainly located on the coast of Alaska, Norway, and Greenland. All reanalyses demonstrate an increase in rainy days, but there is little overall change in ROS events due to the reduction in snow cover days. This work suggests that none of the current reanalyses are reliable in the determination of ROS events due to the poor representation of the rainfall parameterization scheme. The development of alternative strategies that can investigate ROS events at large-scale is urgently needed in a changing Arctic under rapid warming.},

   abstract = {Accurate timely and early-season crop yield estimation within the field variability is important for precision farming and sustainable management applications. Therefore, the ability to estimate the within-field variability of grain yield is crucial for ensuring food security worldwide, especially under climate change. Several Earth observation systems have thus been developed to monitor crops and predict yields. Despite this, new research is required to combine multiplatform data integration, advancements in satellite technologies, data processing, and the application of this discipline to agricultural practices. This study provides further developments in soybean yield estimation by comparing multisource satellite data from PlanetScope (PS), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat 8 (L8) and introducing topographic and meteorological variables. Herein, a new method of combining soybean yield, global positioning systems, harvester data, climate, topographic variables, and remote sensing images has been demonstrated. Soybean yield shape points were obtained from a combine-harvester-installed GPS and yield monitoring system from seven fields over the 2021 season. The yield estimation models were trained and validated using random forest, and four vegetation indices were tested. The result showed that soybean yield can be accurately predicted at 3-, 10-, and 30-m resolutions with mean absolute error (MAE) value of 0.091 t/ha for PS, 0.118 t/ha for S2, and 0.120 t/ha for L8 data (root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.111, 0.076). The combination of the environmental data with the original bands provided further improvements and an accurate yield estimation model within the soybean yield variability with MAE of 0.082 t/ha for PS, 0.097 t/ha for S2, and 0.109 t/ha for L8 (RMSE of 0.094, 0.069, and 0.108 t/ha). The results showed that the optimal date to predict the soybean yield within the field scale was approximately 60 or 70 days before harvesting periods during the beginning bloom stage. The developed model can be applied for other crops and locations when suitable training yield data, which are critical for precision farming, are available.},

New hydrological insights for the region
Long-term time series data such as temperature exhibit non-stationarity, and non-linearity, thus making it more challenging to assessing the future trend and variability. It is shown that for daily maximum temperatures in Taipei, changes in extremes are more pronounced and impactful than changes in the mean values in response to global warming. The newly developed hybrid MCEEMD-RBFNN model is capable of analyzing the nonstationary and nonlinear daily maximum temperature data, and then forecasting the daily maximum temperature over the next 7 days. Short-term trends and variability of daily maximum temperature in Taipei can thus be identified and diagnosed for hazard prevention and risk assessment of heatwave events.},

   abstract = {Study region
Akaki is a headwater catchment of Awash River Basin that hosts the capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. The area encompasses several agglomerated towns, water supply, and hydropower reservoirs and is characterized by a chain of mountains and floodplains. Due to basin rainfall, and the expansion of urbanized areas, the catchment is frequently affected by flooding.
Study focus
This study evaluates dynamic Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach to improve rainfall estimation over the catchment by blending four high-resolution satellite rainfall estimate (SRE) products. Using daily data (2003–2019) observed at thirteen stations as a reference, seven statistical metrics served to assess the point and spatial scale accuracy of the rainfall estimates.
New hydrological insights
Main findings from this study are: (i) the blended product outperformed the individual SRE products by notably improving correlation with in-situ observed rainfall, and reducing the error of the estimated rainfall, (ii) the blended and individual SRE products performed better in the highlands than the lowlands of the catchment, and (iii) the amount of daily rainfall during the main-rainy season was mostly overestimated by the individual SRE products but was fairly estimated by the blended product. This study showed the nonexistence of surpassing individual SRE products and emphasized the blending of several products for gaining optimal results from each product.},

While lossy data compression methods can alleviate this burden, they introduce the possibility that key climate variables could be altered to the point of affecting scientific conclusions. Therefore, developing a detailed understanding of how compressed model output differs from the original is important. Here, we evaluate the effects of two leading compression algorithms, sz and zfp, on daily surface temperature and precipitation rate data from a widely used climate model. While both algorithms show promising fidelity with the original output, detectable artifacts are introduced even at relatively tight error tolerances. This study highlights the need for evaluation methods that are sensitive to errors at different spatiotemporal scales and specific to the particular climate variable of interest.},

Recently, the decline in central Asian terrestrial water storage (TWS) has threatened the health of local ecosystems. Therefore, it is of great significance to adopt an efficient approach to explore and identify the nonlinear relationship between two important indicators, i.e., the TWSA and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the arid central Asian endorheic basins. In this study, we analysed the long-term trends of the TWSA and NDVI, and identified the lag month (1 month) as the optimal moving window of the nonlinear Granger causality test embedded in random forest to detect the nonlinear NDVI change response of NDVI changes in vegetation to the TWSA from 2003 to 2015. There are decreasing trends in TWSAs over approximately 81.7% of the study area and the NDVI generally decreased resulting in approximately 36% vegetation browning in the study area. The nonlinear Granger unidirectional causes of the TWSA were responsible for 97.9% of the NDVI variation in the study area considering the optimal response time for moving windows. The causes of vegetation browning in the central Asian Aral Sea basin and vegetation greening in the basins of Northwest China could be mostly explained by the changes in TWS. Our findings contribute to understanding the nonlinear causal linkages between vegetation and the TWSA in endorheic basins, and these findings provide insights for obtaining terrestrial water consumption patterns and water resource management under the joint influence of climate change and human activities.},

We identify 2719 million hectares of tropical land with ≥10% tree cover, including 680 million hectares in tropical drylands. We find that 52% of tropical cropland and 46% of tropical urban areas had ≥10% tree cover in 2020. Compared to previous datasets, we demonstrate improved ability to map tree extent in areas with high canopy cover heterogeneity and with open canopy cover, especially in drylands, urban areas, and on cropland. As such, this data is expected to enable improved monitoring of tree cover distributions at local scales.},

The turbidity of different water surfaces and its response mechanisms to regional climatic factors and human activities in the Yangtze River Delta Region (YRDR), an important rapid economic development region in China, remain poorly understood. To enhance the knowledge of turbidity variations and dominant drivers of YRDR water surfaces, a complete long-term turbidity series was obtained using Landsat images from 1990 to 2020. The results show that the turbidity trend differed from −1.3 NTU/yr to 0.7 NTU/yr in different water surfaces. Turbidity decreased significantly in the mainstream of the Yangtze River (MYR), aquaculture ponds (AP) and other water bodies, whilst increasing significantly in the medium lakes (ML) and mainstream of the Qiantang River (MQR). Meanwhile, no significant changes in turbidity were observed in the great lakes (GL) and small lakes (SL). Rather than climatic factors, urbanisation and decreasing wastewater discharge were the dominant drivers of turbidity trends during the study period. In addition, ecological engineering in AP increased water transparency. The Three Gorges Dam also decreased turbidity in MYR. Increasing turbidity in the downstream of MQR was driven by increasing seasonal water surfaces and reclamation projects near Hangzhou Bay. GL faced no significant increase in turbidity due to the offset of afforestation to urbanisation-induced turbidity increase. These findings provide important information for government decision-making for subsequent aquatic environmental protection and restoration in the YRDR.},

Analysis among the four AI methods found that ANN performed better when handling a large number of data sets and accurately made predictions due to its ability to model complex non-linear and complex relationships, despite some weaknesses. The findings of this review demonstrate that the successful adoption of AI models is impacted by the appropriateness of input consideration, types of individual functions, the efficiency of performance metrics, etc. The outcomes from this study will be beneficial for groundwater development plans and contribute to the improvement of the AI applications in groundwater quality.

   abstract = {Background
Under-5 mortality rate is an important indicator in Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals. To date, no nationally representative studies have examined the effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on under-5 mortality.
Objective
To investigate the association of short-term exposure to PM2.5 with under-5 mortality from total and specific causes in China.
Methods
We used the national Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System to identify under-5 mortality cases during the study period of 2009 to 2019. We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover study design at the individual level to capture the effect of short-term exposure to daily PM2.5 on under-5 mortality, using conditional logistic regression models.
Results
A total of 61,464 under-5 mortality cases were included. A 10 μg/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5 on lag 0–1 d was significantly associated with a 1.15% (95%confidence interval: 0.65%, 1.65%) increase in under-5 mortality. Mortality from diarrhea, pneumonia, digestive diseases, and preterm birth were significantly associated with exposure to PM2.5. The effect estimates were larger for neonatal mortality (<28 days), female children, and in warm seasons. We observed steeper slopes in lower ranges (<50 μg/m3) of the concentration-response curve between PM2.5 and under-5 mortality, and positive associations remained below the 24-h PM2.5 concentration limit recommended by WHO Air Quality Guidelines and China Air Quality Standards.
Conclusions
This nationwide case-crossover study in China demonstrated that acute exposure to PM2.5 may significantly increase the risk of under-5 mortality, with larger effects for neonates, female children, and during warm seasons. Relevant control strategies are needed to remove this roadblock to achieving under-5 mortality targets in developing countries.},

Humid tropical forests play a dominant role in the functioning of Earth but are under increasing threat from changes in land use and climate. How forest vulnerability varies across space and time and what level of stress forests can tolerate before facing a tipping point are poorly understood. Here, we develop a tropical forest vulnerability index (TFVI) to detect and evaluate the vulnerability of global tropical forests to threats across space and time. We show that climate change together with land-use change have slowed the recovery rate of forest carbon cycling. Temporal autocorrelation, as an indicator of this slow recovery, increases substantially for above-ground biomass, gross primary production, and evapotranspiration when climate stress reaches a critical level. Forests in the Americas exhibit extensive vulnerability to these stressors, while in Africa, forests show relative resilience to climate, and in Asia reveal more vulnerability to land use and fragmentation. TFVI can systematically track the response of tropical forests to multiple stressors and provide early-warning signals for regions undergoing critical transitions.},

   abstract = {As the largest cotton-growing region in China, Xinjiang has contributed more than 80% of the total national cotton production in recent years. Timely and accurate estimation of cotton yield in Xinjiang is important for sustainable agricultural development and food security. However, most current studies have been devoted to the linkage of crop yield with remotely sensed reflectance and climate parameters. This has caused numerous uncertainties due to that these explanatory variables are unable to quickly reflect the actual photosynthetic dynamics of crops. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), as a direct proxy of plant photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP), has recently been suggested to be a promising method for crop yield estimation, but the spatial resolution of current SIF products derived from satellites is usually very low (such as Global OCO-2 SIF (GOSIF): 0.05°). This greatly limited the ability of SIF to accurately estimate field-scale cotton yield in Xinjiang. Here, we first proposed a two-step convolutional neural network (CNN) strategy to downscale the monthly GOSIF products sequentially from 0.05°, 0.005° to 0.0005° to match the size of cotton field parcels, and then linear regression and random forest (RF) regression were respectively conducted using the monthly downscaled SIF product (CNN-SIF) to assess its feasibility to estimate field-scale yield. Results showed that the proposed stepwise approach for downscaling GOSIF worked well, indicating a high goodness of fit (R2 > 0.85) with the referenced SIF as well as strong correlations to both GPP products and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) (the median r > 0.90). On this basis, preferable accuracies (the optimal R2 = 0.62 and the ratio of prediction to deviation = 1.64) were also achieved for our proposed cotton yield estimation models in the Mosuowan region, Xinjiang only by the 0.0005° SIF products. With the assistance of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), the higher performance was given (R2 = 0.67 and RPD = 1.72). This study reveals the importance of finer-resolution SIF products for accurate crop yield estimation and offers a promising and practical approach for estimating agricultural yield, especially for fragmented farmlands.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of climate and land use change on fish catch, lacking a systematic understanding of the driving mechanisms and restriction threshold value, especially in high-latitude lakes. In this study, a novel approach that combined Bayesian Modeling (BNM) with remote sensing was developed to identify the drivers and determine the threshold of climate warming and agricultural land expansion. Our results demonstrate that air temperature (ATP) and agricultural land use (ALU) are key factors resulting in the reduction of fish catch, while relative humidity index (RHI) may only play a minor role. Compared with the mean value of the fish catch between 2004 and 2019, increasing 2.5 °C would result in significant decrease in the fish catch. The increasing of 14.41% expansion of agricultural land use would also lead to a significant decline in the fish catch.

   abstract = {Ammonia emissions to the atmosphere have a range of negative impacts on environmental quality, human health, and biodiversity. Despite the considerable efforts in quantifying spatially explicit ammonia emissions, there are significant uncertainties in ammonia emission estimates at regional scales. We aimed to improve the modeling of atmospheric ammonia emission variability in space and time across the Netherlands by updating an agricultural ammonia emission model with a newly derived high-resolution crop map and a livestock housing location database of the Netherlands. To generate a crop map of 12 agricultural land cover classes, we applied random forest classification to the multi-temporal multispectral observations of surface reflectance and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2. The crop statistics were used to calculate ammonia emission distribution based on nitrogen demand (manure and mineral fertilizer needed) of different crop types using the INTEGRATOR model. Next, the crop map was utilized to spatially allocate the ammonia emissions to a high-resolution grid across the Netherlands. In addition, ammonia emissions from livestock housing systems were introduced as point sources using location data from the Geographic Information Agricultural Business system. The temporal emission variability was updated using a recently developed TIMELINES module. After the spatial and temporal distribution of ammonia emission was obtained with the crop map and housing information, it was imported into the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to model ammonia surface concentration for validation with in situ measurements. The performed crop classification has an average accuracy score of 0.73. The derived crop map was compared with Dutch national statistics, and the results showed that the absolute median of the relative difference between Sentinel-2 derived crop areas and national statistical information is around 5%. The newly modeled ammonia monthly surface concentrations compared better with in situ measurements in terms of the magnitude and temporal variability than those derived from the original emission distribution, indicating that the temporal distribution of ammonia emissions was improved. The comparison of modeled and measured annual averaged surface concentrations illustrated that the spatial distribution of ammonia emission was also improved. All model performance indicators significantly improved, and the performance of the updated model was more stable and robust. The improvement was more evident at the stations where livestock housing is the main emission source. This study illustrates that apart from a satellite-derived crop map, information on the locations of animal housing systems also plays an essential role in better estimates of the spatial and temporal distribution of ammonia emissions. It can be worthwhile to extrapolate the method to other regions in Europe and elsewhere.},

   abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystem carbon sequestration is one of the most economically feasible and important ways to mitigate the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration. China's terrestrial ecosystems have a huge carbon sequestration potential. Therefore, the study on the carbon sequestration potential of vegetation ecosystems is related to the smooth implementation of China's carbon neutrality strategy in 2060. Based on the CMIP6 shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) scenarios, changes in the vegetation aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) were estimated using the Lund–Potsdam–Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ) model (1981–2060) for China. Subsequently, the vegetation ABC dynamics were analyzed under three future scenarios based on the traditional Multi-Model Ensemble Mean (MME) method for different eco-regions in China. We found that the vegetation ABC density was 32.38 Mg/ha in China with an increasing trend of 53.99% from 1981 to 2014. The vegetation ABC density was higher in sub-regions I, II, V, and VI. Due to the main forest carbon sinks was appeared in Southwest, Northeast and Southeast of China. However, the water conditions are poor in sub-regions III, VII, and VIII, and mostly covered by desert and steppe vegetation where the productivity level is low. Under SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios, the vegetation ABC would show a decreasing trend from 2015 to 2040 with a reduction rate of 4.34% and 4.60%, but exhibit an increasing trend from 2041 to 2060 with a growth rate of 1.46% and 0.97%. While the vegetation ABC would show a decreasing trend during 2015 to 2060 with a reduction rate of 14.78% under SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Additionally, temperature and precipitation are main factors influencing the vegetation ABC. In the future scenario, due to higher temperatures resulted in the decrease of vegetation ABC in the cold temperate humid and temperate humid/sub-humid regions. However, in the northwestern arid region and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region may have been due to relatively low temperatures in the region, warming may address this limitation and lead to a general increase in ABC.},

   abstract = {Land degradation is a major environmental and social issue in temperate steppes. It is commonly determined from vegetation cover using remote sensing techniques. Steppes in eastern Mongolia are subject to resource extraction activities, such as mining and oil extraction, which affect land degradation. Recent technological progress in remote sensing has facilitated the acquirement of high-resolution data by, for example, the CubeSat satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), providing data for detailed maps of vegetation cover and plant functional groups (PFGs). Traditional methods for monitoring vegetation cover often face typical scale issues, such as the upscaling of vegetation parameters if plot-scale field measurements are integrated to satellite data. Here, we studied the spatial distribution of PFG using machine learning and a combination of field measurements, UAV imagery (spatial resolution: 2 cm), and PlanetScope multi-temporal imagery. We provide two products at two spatial resolutions: one for UAV data, which is restricted to comparatively small areas around field measurements, and one for PlanetScope, which covers large parts of northeastern Mongolia. The results showed that the overall accuracies of UAV classification were 91–95%, whereas those of PlanetScope were 78–95%. In integrating the classified UAV data to the PlaneScope data, our proposed model minimized the scale issue that often impedes classification. Importantly, our findings revealed that the ecological effects of dirt road and railroad extended up to 60–120 m into the adjacent, otherwise less degraded steppe vegetation. A comparison between burned and unburned areas in different years indicates that wildfires affect the composition of PFG in reducing the fractional cover of graminoids and forbs, and that increasing cover of bare ground leads to a distinct and patchy mosaic of different vegetation types.},

In this study, we developed a detection method that combines climatologically homogeneous region recognition and semiparametric regression to quantitatively calculate the contribution of human activities and climate to CO2 emissions. On the basis of determining the composition of CO2 emissions in Shanxi coalfield, we calculated the value of four CO2 emissions components (coal mining, climate, other disturbances and random fluctuation), analyzed their temporal and spatial regulation, and discussed the relationship between each component and land use. The results show that the coal mining component accounted for the largest proportion, 81 % of the CO2 emissions, and the climate component accounted for the smallest proportion. From 2000 to 2019, the CO2 emissions and coal mining component in the study area showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, reaching maximum monthly values of 65.5 t and 55.6 t in 2009 and declining in 2010 and 2018, respectively. The components of CO2 emissions were strongly correlated with the land cover types. Forestland had the lowest climate component (-0.35 t), as well as other disturbances component (7.37 t). Farmland had the lowest coal mining component (20.14 t). Water and built-up land had the highest value of each component. In the future, the climate component of farms in the study area will show an upward trend, while forestland, grassland and water will show a downward trend. The detection methods of CO2 emission components can be incorporated into the ecosystem model to improve the governance and protection ability of the ecological environment.},

   abstract = {The growth of agricultural production systems is a major driver of groundwater depletion worldwide. Balancing groundwater supply and food production requires localized understanding of groundwater storage and depletion variations in response to diverse cropping systems and surface water availability for irrigation. While advances through Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) have facilitated estimating the groundwater storage (GWS) changes in recent years, the coarse resolution of GRACE data hinders the characterization of GWS variation hotspots. Herein, we present a novel spatial water balance approach to improve the distributed estimation of groundwater storage and depletion changes at a spatial scale that can detect the hotspots of GWS variation. We used a mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model to downscale GRACE Level-3 data from coarse resolution (1° × 1°) to fine scale (1 km × 1 km) based on high resolution environmental variables. We then combined the downscaled GRACE-based GWS variations with results from a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We demonstrate an application of the approach in the Irrigated Indus Basin (IIB). Between 2002 and 2019, total loss of groundwater reserves varied in the IIB's 55 canal command areas with the highest loss observed in Dehli Doab by >50 km3 followed by 7.8–49 km3 in the upstream, and 0.77–7.77 km3 in the downstream canal command areas. GWS declined by −325.55 mm/year at Dehli Doab, followed by −186.86 mm/year at BIST Doab, −119.20 mm/year at BARI Doab, and −100.82 mm/year at JECH Doab. The rate of groundwater depletion is increasing in the canal command areas of Delhi Doab and BIST Doab by 0.21–0.35 m/year. Larger groundwater depletion in some canal command areas (e.g., RACHNA, BIST Doab, and Delhi Doab) is associated with the rice-wheat cropping system, low rainfall, and low flows from tributaries.},

Changes in one or more of these spheres can result in a cascade of changes throughout the system in ways that are often poorly understood. Here we investigate how past and present climate change have impacted permafrost, hydrology, and ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau. We do this by compiling existing climate, hydrologic, cryosphere, biosphere, and geologic studies documenting change over decadal to glacial-interglacial timescales and longer. Our emphasis is on showing present-day trends in environmental change and how plateau ecosystems have largely flourished under warmer and wetter periods in the geologic past. We identify two future pathways that could lead to either a favorable greening or unfavorable degradation and desiccation of plateau ecosystems. Both paths are plausible given the available evidence. We contend that the key to which pathway future generations experience lies in what, if any, human intervention measures are implemented. We conclude with suggested management strategies that can be implemented to facilitate a future greening of the Tibetan Plateau.},

Combined with interpretability techniques, machine learning could replace human modeler and shift the focus of human effort to extracting the knowledge from the ready-made models and articulating that knowledge into intuitive descroptions of reality. This perspective makes the case in favor of the larger role that exploratory and data-driven approach to computational neuroscience could play while coexisting alongside the traditional hypothesis-driven approach. We exemplify the proposed approach in the context of the knowledge representation taxonomy with three research projects that employ interpretability techniques on top of machine learning methods at three different levels of neural organization. The first study (Chapter 3) explores feature importance analysis of a random forest decoder trained on intracerebral recordings from 100 human subjects to identify spectrotemporal signatures that characterize local neural activity during the task of visual categorization. The second study (Chapter 4) employs representation similarity analysis to compare the neural responses of the areas along the ventral stream with the activations of the layers of a deep convolutional neural network. The third study (Chapter 5) proposes a method that allows test subjects to visually explore the state representation of their neural signal in real time. This is achieved by using a topology-preserving dimensionality reduction technique that allows to transform the neural data from the multidimensional representation used by the computer into a two-dimensional representation a human can grasp. The approach, the taxonomy, and the examples, present a strong case for the applicability of machine learning methods to automatic knowledge discovery in neuroscience.},

From their successes and failures, we can learn about the computational requirements of the different tasks at which brains excel. Deep learning also provides the tools for testing cognitive theories. In order to test a theory, we need to realise the proposed information-processing system at scale, so as to be able to assess its feasibility and emergent behaviours. Deep learning allows us to scale up from principles and circuit models to end-to-end trainable models capable of performing complex tasks. There are many levels at which cognitive neuroscientists can use deep learning in their work, from inspiring theories to serving as full computational models. Ongoing advances in deep learning bring us closer to understanding how cognition and perception may be implemented in the brain -- the grand challenge at the core of cognitive neuroscience.},

For this we make use of brain EEG signals triggered from visual stimuli like images and leverage the natural synchronization between images and their corresponding brain signals to learn a novel representation of the cognitive feature space. The concept of knowledge distillation has been used here for training the deep cognition model, CogniNet1, by employing a student-teacher learning technique in order to bridge the process of inter-modal knowledge transfer. The proposed novel architecture obtains stateof-the-art results, signiﬁcantly surpassing other existing models.

            Climate-driven changes in precipitation amounts and their seasonal variability are expected in many continental-scale regions during the remainder of the 21st century. However, much less is known about future changes in the predictability of seasonal precipitation, an important earth system property relevant for climate adaptation. Here, on the basis of CMIP6 models that capture the present-day teleconnections between seasonal precipitation and previous-season sea surface temperature (SST), we show that climate change is expected to alter the SST-precipitation relationships and thus our ability to predict seasonal precipitation by 2100. Specifically, in the tropics, seasonal precipitation predictability from SSTs is projected to increase throughout the year, except the northern Amazonia during boreal winter. Concurrently, in the extra-tropics predictability is likely to increase in central Asia during boreal spring and winter. The altered predictability, together with enhanced interannual variability of seasonal precipitation, poses new opportunities and challenges for regional water management.},

However, such effects have not been well understood, particularly over rainfed croplands, partly because of the poor representation of green water in associated assessments. In this study, we develop an integrated agricultural water scarcity index (WSIag) that incorporates blue and green water components to examine the agricultural water scarcity in the baseline (1981–2005) and future (2026–2050) periods under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 and RCP6.0 scenarios. Results show that ∼3.8 million km 2 (∼39% of total) croplands experienced water scarcity in the baseline period and it would expand by more than 3% in the future. Under the two scenarios, WSIag projections are similar overall and are higher than that under the baseline in 83%–84% of global total croplands. Differences are found between the scenarios in Amazonia, Southern Africa, and South Asia. The increases in future WSIag are dominated by the decreased water availability in ∼60% of total croplands and ∼24% of which is dominated by the increased crop water requirement. Changes in green water availability have a significant contribution to changes in WSIag in 16% of global croplands, mostly in arid/semiarid regions (e.g., the South edge of the Sahel, Southern Africa, Northeast China, and Central America). This implies the important role of green water management for agriculture in these regions. The integrated assessment can help develop effective strategies for agricultural water management under climate change.},

Crop production can increase if irrigated areas are expanded or irrigation is intensiﬁed, but these may increase the rate of environmental degradation. Since climate change impacts on soil water balance will lead to changes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, consequently, the crop growth period may shorten in the future impacting on water productivity. Crop yields aﬀected by climate change are projected to be diﬀerent in various areas, in some areas crop yields will increase, and for other areas it will decrease depending on the latitude of the area and irrigation application. Existing modelling results show that an increase in precipitation will increase crop yield, and what is more, crop yield is more sensitive to the precipitation than temperature. If water availability is reduced in the future, soils of high water holding capacity will be better to reduce the impact of drought while maintaining crop yield. With the temperature increasing and precipitation ﬂuctuations, water availability and crop production are likely to decrease in the future. If the irrigated areas are expanded, the total crop production will increase; however, food and environmental quality may degrade.},

   abstract = {Precipitation prediction plays a crucial role in modern agriculture and industry. However, it poses significant challenges due to the diverse patterns and dynamics in time and space, as well as the scarcity of high precipitation events. To address this challenge, we propose an ensemble learning framework that leverages multiple learners to capture the diverse patterns of precipitation distribution. Specifically, the framework consists of a precipitation predictor with multiple lightweight heads (learners) and a controller that combines the outputs from these heads. The learners and the controller are separately optimized with a proposed 3-stage training scheme. By utilizing provided satellite images, the proposed approach can effectively model the intricate rainfall patterns, especially for high precipitation events. It achieved 1st place on the core test as well as the nowcasting leaderboards of the Weather4Cast 2023 competition.

   abstract = {The application of neural networks (NN) in groundwater (GW) level prediction has been shown promising by previous works. Yet, previous works have relied on a variety of inputs, such as air temperature, pumping rates, precipitation, service population, and others. This work presents a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN) for GW level forecasting using only previously observed GW level data as the input without resorting to any other type of data and information about a groundwater basin. This work applies the LSTM-NN for short-term and long-term GW level forecasting in the Edwards aquifer in Texas. The Adam optimizer is employed for training the LSTM-NN. The performance of the LSTM-NN was compared with that of a simple NN under 36 different scenarios with prediction horizons ranging from one day to three months, and covering several conditions of data availability. This paper’s results demonstrate the superiority of the LSTM-NN over the simple-NN in all scenarios and the success of the LSTM-NN in accurate GW level prediction. The LSTM-NN predicts one lag, up to four lags, and up to 26 lags ahead GW level with an accuracy (R2) of at least 99.89%, 99.00%, and 90.00%, respectively, over a testing period longer than 17 years of the most recent records. The quality of this work’s results demonstrates the capacity of machine learning (ML) in groundwater prediction, and affirms the importance of gathering high-quality, long-term, GW level data for predicting key groundwater characteristics useful in sustainable groundwater management.},

This study has proposed hybrid artificial neural network models that predicted monthly radiation using typical weather and geographic data. Two datasets and six artificial neural network models were respectively built for indigenous and widespread regions around the world. The referred models co-optimized the artificial neural network properties and feature selection. For this purpose, an adaptive evolutionary algorithm improving prediction performance was developed to train the neural networks. This novel approach has yielded promising results compared to the developed deep learning models in this study. The results revealed that while the indigenous models had common features of longitude, sunshine durations, precipitation, and wind speed, the widespread models involved those of latitude, sunshine durations, and mean daily maximum air temperature. The proposed hybrid model had respectively the best mean absolute percentage errors of 2.45% and 9.93% for validation dataset and 3.75% and 11.03% for testing dataset of the indigenous and widespread regions, respectively. The present findings showed that the proposed hybrid model could be evaluated as a generic model and could improve the forecasting accuracy with the specified optimization parameters.},

Various model input combinations, including GWL, precipitation, temperature, and surface water level variables, have been derived based on proposed correlation analysis using singular spectrum analysis (SSA) remainders. The models have been trained on data subsets of varying lengths to identify the optimal training data duration. Additionally, we have introduced the bagging ensemble learning method to enhance the performance of the CANFIS model. As part of a comprehensive model evaluation process, the best-performing CANFIS model for each forecasting scenario has undergone uncertainty analysis using bootstrap sampling. Our results reveal that the CANFIS model performs satisfactorily for daily forecasting but leaves room for improvement in monthly forecasting, particularly for two-month and three-month ahead forecasts. Moreover, we have identified several optimal input combinations, highlighting the significance of the temperature variable in monthly forecasting. Furthermore, our findings indicate that additional training data does not necessarily lead to improved performance. The ensemble CANFIS model has demonstrated significant performance enhancement, particularly for monthly forecasting. Finally, the CANFIS model uncertainty analysis has shown satisfactory results for daily forecasting scenarios, while monthly forecasting models exhibit higher uncertainties, particularly during periods with distinctly different GWL fluctuation patterns.},

Although deep neural networks (DNN) are powerful tools in the modelling of environmental phenomena, they are recognized as being challenging to interpret due to their black-box nature. To address this issue and understand the importance of each environmental control on dust pollution, game theory (i.e., Shapley values) was used to better understand the performance and interpretability of DNN models. Here, monthly mean values of precipitation, air temperature, surface wind speed, potential evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference salinity index, Palmer drought severity index, soil heat flux, and surface pressure were selected as explanatory variables. The dust storm index (DSI), an indicator of dust pollution, was the predicted response variable for the cold and warm months. The results showed that the accuracies of the DNN model in predicting cold months DSI (CMDSI) and warm months DSI (WMDSI) were higher compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms. DNN model increased the R2 by 13% and 15% for predicting CMDSI and WMDSI, respectively, compared to the Random Forest model, which was the second most effective approach. According to the Shapley values, the most important controls on the occurrence of dust storms during the cold months of the study period (2000–2018) were wind speed, soil heat flux, and precipitation. During the warm months, wind speed was the most important controlling factor and was followed by precipitation, soil heat flux, and potential evapotranspiration. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DNN model and game theory in identifying the factors affecting dust pollution, which may help mitigate its impacts on the residents of western Iran.},

The chosen study area is the Gangetic West Bengal (GWB) region, India and the chosen meteorological drivers at the surface and different pressure levels are the 12 probable predictors, viz. air temperature, total precipitable water, relative humidity, geo-potential height, zonal wind, meridional wind, omega and soil moisture, each up to a lead time of 6 months, making a total of 72 inputs. Within the BN architecture, two heuristic algorithms namely Hill-Climb (HC) and Max-Min Hill Climb (MMHC) were used to establish that a large part (89% for HC and 97% for MMHC) of the input information was redundant, given the potential predictors that are selected via these algorithms. The potential predictors revealed via these algorithms include geo-potential height at a pressure of 850 mb, total precipitable water, and soil moisture, each at a lead time of 2 months. The selected predictors were further used to develop a prediction model that results in good agreement with the observations. Additionally, two widely used machine learning techniques namely, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were also used to develop standalone models wherein all the 72 probable predictors are used for prediction, and also in conjunction with BN (i.e., BN-ANN and BN-SVR), wherein only the drivers selected via BN are used as predictors. The results indicate that the parsimonious models perform better or equally well as the higher dimensional models, with refined Index of agreement values: MDBN = 0.824, MDBN-ANN = 0.835 and MDBN-SVR = 0.841, MDANN = 0.813, MDSVR = 0.823, and Normalized Mean Square Error values: NMSEBN = 0.242, NMSEBN-ANN = 0.226 and NMSEBN-SVR = 0.234, NMSEANN = 0.226, NMSESVR = 0.238 for validation period (averaged values across three folds).

The improved Bristow–Campbell (IBC) model and the improved Ångström–Prescott (IA–P) model are compared with the ANN model to explore the best model in solar radiation modeling. Daily meteorological parameters, such as sunshine duration hours, mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, air pressure, water vapor pressure, and wind speed, along with station-measured GSR and a daily surface GSR dataset over China obtained from the Data Assimilation and Modeling Center for Tibetan Multi-spheres (DAM), are used to predict GSR and to validate the models in this work. The ANN model with the network of 9-17-1 provides better accuracy than the two improved empirical models in GSR estimation. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and determination coefficient (R2) are 2.65MJm−2, −0.94MJm−2, and 0.68 in the IA−P model; 2.19MJm−2, 1.11MJm−2, and 0.83 in the IBC model; 1.34MJm−2, −0.11MJm−2, and 0.91 in the ANN model, respectively. The regional monthly mean GSR in the measured dataset, DAM dataset, and ANN model is analyzed. The RMSE (RMSE %) is 1.07MJm−2 (8.91%) and the MBE (MBE %) is −0.62MJm−2 (−5.21%) between the measured and ANN-estimated GSR. The statistical errors of RMSE (RMSE %) are 0.91MJm−2 (7.28%) and those of MBE (MBE %) are −0.15MJm−2 (−1.20%) between DAM and ANN-modeled GSR. The correlation coefficients and R2 are larger than 0.95. The regional mean GSR is 12.58MJm−2. The lowest GSR is observed in the northwest area, and it increases from northwest to southeast. The annual mean GSR decreases by 0.02MJm−2decade−1 over the entire southeast China. The GSR in 52 stations experiences a decreasing trend, and 21% of the stations are significant at the 95% level.},

   abstract = {Droughts, due to their complex nature, are difficult to predict; however, research is showing that there are often clearly defined patterns to their occurrence. The temporal aspects are usually more apparent when comparing regions with defined climatic characteristics, such as those with recognized wet or dry seasons, but recognizing these patterns can help in defining and understanding the overall processes influencing drought occurrence. Especially in the context of climate change, it is crucial to recognize temporal patterns and quantify them to help diagnose current and future event probabilities. The objective of this work is to introduce a new tool for assessing temporal patterns of streamflow drought, based on the harmonic oscillator theorem called the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend (HOST) model. The testing dataset consists of monthly minimal flows and drought occurrence information calculated based on daily flows from the National Water Model (NWM) retrospective v.2.1 dataset for the period 1979–2020. The model framework allows for trend and seasonality signal decomposition as well as the extraction of the first five harmonics by means of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based machine learning algorithm. The model framework enables the extraction and evaluation of five different harmonic models based on short and long-range components as well as linear regression sloped harmonics. The results show that the best-fit models are based on two superimposed sinusoidal functions with an accuracy of around 70–90 % for streamflow drought occurrence, with different spatial parameters reflecting varied environmental conditions. The models were able to capture two patterns: (1) annual precipitation variation and (2) longer-term inertia, the latter of which is likely driven by large-scale circulation with a roughly-eight year period.},

Three supervised learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) and time series forecasting model: SARIMA model, are used in this study. The monthly meteorological data of minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), precipitation (P), sunshine hours (SH), wind speed (WS), and relative humidity (H) data from 1994 to 2019 are collected for modeling WFs by applying different scenarios of climate variables. The results show that the ANN method with hidden layers (8, 6) combined with input variables Tmax, Tmin, P, Kc, SH, and H was the best model to estimate WFb, the ANN with hidden layers (7, 5) combined with Tmax, Tmin, P, WS, and SH was the optimal estimation model for WFg. These WF estimation models achieve satisfying accuracy and coefficients of determination close to 1. Additionally, SARIMA models are integrated with the developed Artificial intelligence (AI) estimation model for WFs prediction. The results show that the WFs forecasting values can effectively match the overall trend of WFs. Thus, the AI-SARIMA coupled prediction models developed in this study are recommended for WFs estimation and prediction of energy crops in similar regions. Furthermore, this research can guide decision-making for water, agricultural, and biofuels managers and planners.},

The ability of dynamic weather models to represent changes in atmospheric variability at time scales on the order of months is limited, such that meteorologists typically resort to climatic scales to assess predictability. Atmospheric teleconnections provide an opportunity to assess interconnectedness at a planetary scale and have known relationships with seasonal features, particularly in wintertime temperatures and precipitation. However, these teleconnections are difficult to predict owing to their chaotic nature. In this study, the predictability of the cold-season monthly phases of four common teleconnection indices, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific North American oscillation (PNA), the West Pacific Oscillation (WPO), and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) is quantified using multiple machine learning methods. Lagged indices out to 6 months are employed for all four teleconnection patterns are used to predict each upcoming teleconnection index. Improvements offered by support vector machines and random forests are compared against a baseline multivariate linear regression to quantify the benefits of applying machine learning to the research problem. Ultimately, the resulting models offer a first attempt at quantifying monthly atmospheric variability using machine learning and are an important first step towards improved medium and long-range weather forecasting.},

Based on multicollinearity test using the Variance Inflation Factor, four climatic factors and six landuse types were used as independent variables for NDVI simulation. The calibrated and validated statistical vegetation models denoted good performance using four machine learning algorithms. The ensemble results from the four machine learning modelling were used to assess the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature and precipitation change on annual and monthly scale. Based on historical climatic variability and future scenarios, eight hypothetical climatic scenarios for the changes in temperature and precipitation were used in this study. The results indicated that there were positive responses of NDVI to temperature and precipitation change. As an one °C increase in temperature, the NDVI was going to increase by 3.03%–5.79%, and it would increase by 3.35%–4.80% when the precipitation increased 10% in the YHHRB. Relatively, the NDVI was more sensitive to precipitation decrease than increase. The sensitivity of NDVI to temperature or precipitation was non-linear as temperature or precipitation changing for a specified climatic zone. Monthly, the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature change varied among the four climatic zones, but as precipitation increasing, the higher and lower sensitivity of NDVI were investigated in wetter and drier months, respectively. Spatially, the NDVI was more sensitive to temperature and precipitation in colder and drier areas, respectively. Landuse also has a significant impact on the sensitivity of NDVI to climate change. The results might be useful for understanding the climate-vegetation dynamics and landuse management under future climate change.},

In this work, we apply support vector regression (SVR) methodology (a class of machine learning algorithm) for prediction of monthly standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for nine stations in Australia. SVR model is trained using 12 predictive variables: rainfall, mean, minimum, and maximum air temperatures, evapotranspiration supplemented by climate indices (southern oscillation index, Pacific decadal oscillation, southern annular mode, and Indian Ocean dipole), and sea surface temperatures (Niño 3.0, 3.4, and 4.0) with data for the period 1915–2000. The objective variable for SVR is the SPEI value in each measuring station. SVR is evaluated using statistical coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and mean absolute error, yielding time-average values of 0.523–0.984, 0.134–0.711, and 0.093–0.522, respectively. Willmott’s index of agreement and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient are between 0.876–0.996 and 0.643–0.982. When errors are analyzed, 90% of simulations have error less than ±0.50. Analysis of severity (S), duration (D), and intensity (I) of drought in test period yields differences between −1.1% and +38.3% (S), −16.1% and 1.3% (D), and −47.4% and 2.0% (I), respectively. We ascertain that SVR is considerably efficient in predicting drought properties.},

We created this dataset from the daily data in grids of 25 km x 25 km provided by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. We matched the map with the raw data to a map with the administrative boundaries of European NUTS 3 regions. After appropriately weighting, we calculated the monthly, regional mean, variance and kurtosis of the following variables: maximum, minimum, average air temperature in degrees Centigrade, sum of precipitation in mm and snow depth in cm. We report the covariance between the average temperature and the precipitation as well.},

   abstract = {Drought forecasting with a long lead time is essential for early warning systems and risk management strategies. The use of machine learning algorithms has been proven to be beneficial in forecasting droughts. However, forecasting at long lead times remains a challenge due to the effects of climate change and the complexities involved in drought assessment. The rise of deep learning techniques can solve this issue, and the present work aims to use a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to forecast a commonly used drought measure, namely, the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index. The model was then applied to the New South Wales region of Australia, with hydrometeorological and climatic variables as predictors. The multivariate interpolated grid of the Climatic Research Unit was used to compute the index at monthly scales, with meteorological variables as predictors. The architecture was trained using data from the period of 1901–2000 and tested on data from the period of 2001–2018. The results were then forecasted at lead times ranging from 1 month to 12 months. The forecasted results were analysed in terms of drought characteristics, such as drought intensity, drought onset, spatial extent and number of drought months, to elucidate how these characteristics improve the understanding of drought forecasting. The drought intensity forecasting capability of the model used two statistical metrics, namely, the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error. The variation in the number of drought months was examined using the threat score technique. The results of this study showed that the stacked LSTM model can forecast effectively at short-term and long-term lead times. Such findings will be essential for government agencies and can be further tested to understand the forecasting capability of the presented architecture at shorter temporal scales, which can range from days to weeks.},

   abstract = {The development of advanced technologies based on computer aid models in the domain of crops and agriculture productively is a modern advancement. Machine learning (ML) based forecasting of the short-term drought indicators (e.g., Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) based on individual signals is a complex process that involves several factors including data quality and availability, inherent signal complexity, non-stationarity of climate, and uncertainty in ML models. Recent achievements in the field of Fourier-based signal processing integrated with advanced deep learning approaches have made it possible to produce very accurate intelligent frameworks for multi-temporal drought indicators and fill this gap. In this research, a new ultramodern complementary intelligent framework comprised of the SelectKbest feature selection (FS), Empirical Fourier Decomposition (EFD), and deep ensemble random vector functional link (Deep RVFL) was developed for multi-temporal monthly forecasting of short-term drought indicators for three and six months (SPEI3 and SPEI6) for two different very hot and semi-humid climate zones of Iran.. For this purpose, the most influential time lags associated with each drought indicator were indicated using the SelectKbest FS in each zone. Afterwards, the individual SPEI signals were decomposed by the EFD technique imposing the most important lagged components to feed the ML approaches. Here, a new hybrid architecture deep learning model, namely a convolutional neural network coupled with a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-Bi-GRU) designed for multi-temporal drought forecasting in the next one-and three- months. Two advanced approaches, introducing the convolutional neural network coupled with bidirectional recurrent neural network (CNN-Bi-RNN), and Random vector function link (RVFL) were adopted to validate the main model (EFD-DeepRVFL) in complementary and standalone counterpart forms. The robustness of all the models was examined using several metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), reliability, and squared Chi-square Distance (SquD). The comprehensive assessment of the outcomes of hybrid schemes revealed that EFD-DeepRVFL owing to superior performance (R2|SPEI3(t + 1) = 0.953, R2|SPEI3(t + 3) = 0.837, R2|SPEI6(t + 1) = 0.962, and R2|SPEI6(t + 3) = 0.887) at Ahvaz station and (R2|SPEI3(t + 1) = 0.964, R2|SPEI3(t + 3) = 0.863, R2|SPEI6(t + 1) = 0.935, and R2|SPEI6(t + 3) = 0.839) at Kermanshah station outperformed the EFD-RVFL and CNN-Bi-RNN, respectively. The developed expert system provides early warning of drought conditions, as a decision-making tool, crop yield prediction, and water resources risk assessment.},

   abstract = {Climate change (CC) poses a threat to renewable hydropower, which continues to play a significant role in energy generation in West Africa (WA). Thus, the assessment of the impacts of climate change and climate variability on hydropower generation is critical for dam management. This study develops a framework based on ensemble climate models and ensemble machine learning methods to assess the projected impacts of CC on inflow to the reservoir and hydropower generation at the Nangbeto Hydropower plant in WA. Inflow to reservoir and energy generation for the future (2020–2099) is modeled using climate models output data from Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment to produce a publicly accessible hydropower dataset from 1980 to 2099. The bias-adjusted ensemble mean of eleven climate models for representative concentration pathways (RC4.5 and RCP8.5) are used. The added value of this approach is to use fewer input data (temperature and precipitation) while focusing on their lagged effect on inflow and energy. Generally, the model output strongly correlates with the observation (1986–2005) with a Pearson correlation of 0.86 for energy and 0.82 for inflow while the mean absolute error is 2.97% for energy and 9.73% for inflow. The results reveals that both inflow and energy simulated over the future periods (2020–2039, 2040–2059, 2060–2079, and 2080–2099) will decrease relative to the historical period (1986–2005) for both RCPs in the range of (2.5–20.5% and 1–8.5% for inflow and energy, respectively), at annual, monthly and seasonal time scales. Therefore, these results should be considered by decision-makers when assessing the best option for the energy mix development plan.},

   abstract = {Precipitation intensity is an important meteorological input for water erosion and runoff applications. A commonly used intensity factor is maximum 30-min intensity (I30), which represents the sustained intensity of a storm. Determining I30 is challenging for two reasons. First, intensity can vary significantly over time, even within very short durations of 5 min or less. Second, the majority of precipitation data sets are limited by their fixed-interval nature, and I30 may not be constant within fixed measurement intervals. When intensity is simply averaged given the accumulation of a measurement interval, the temporal resolution of the precipitation data set biases the result. Therefore, in this study, bias adjustments were determined for a range of selected temporal resolutions and Köppen-Geiger climate regions in the United States. In this case, the intensity factor was monthly mean maximum 30-minute intensity (MX.5P), which is a parameter used to generate stochastic meteorological inputs for models that include the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion model (RHEM) and the Water Erosion Prediction Project model (WEPP). The adjustment factors were obtained by using linear regression of reference MX.5P values derived from breakpoint data against MX.5P values aggregated from the breakpoint data to represent lower temporal resolutions. The resulting slope coefficients were used to determine bias adjustment factors. In addition, multivariate machine learning regression was used to obtain more complex correlations involving a host of predictor variables that may each be determined from daily precipitation statistics and the spatial location of each station. In total, 609 stations and 16 climate classifications were represented in the regressions. Linear regressions for climate classifications gave RMSE for values of MX.5P derived from hourly data ranging from 0.98 to 3.46 mm hr−1 with an average of 2.18 mm hr−1. For daily data, the error range was 2.83–8.44 mm hr−1 with an average of 5.61 mm hr−1. The multivariate regression using machine learning algorithms improved regressions for coarser resolutions, reducing error to the 3–4 mm hr−1 range for downscaled daily values.},

   abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an effective indicator for water pollution. However, since DO is a non-optically active parameter and has little impact on the spectrum captured by satellite sensors, research on estimating DO by remote sensing at multiple spatiotemporal scales is limited. In this study, the support vector regression (SVR) models were developed and validated using the remote sensing reflectance derived from both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and synchronous DO measurements (N = 188) and water temperature of Lake Huron and three other inland waterbodies (N = 282) covering latitude between 22–45 °N. Using the developed models, spatial distributions of the annual and monthly DO variability since 1984 and the annual monthly DO variability since 2000 in Lake Huron were reconstructed for the first time. The impacts of five climate factors on long-term DO trends were analyzed. Results showed that the developed SVR-based models had good robustness and generalization (average R2 = 0.91, root mean square percentage error = 2.65%, mean absolute percentage error = 4.21%), and performed better than random forest and multiple linear regression. The monthly DO estimates by Landsat and MODIS data were highly consistent (average R2 = 0.88). From 1984 to 2019, the oxygen loss in Lake Huron was 6.56%. Air temperature, incident shortwave radiation flux density, and precipitation were the main climate factors affecting annual DO of Lake Huron. This study demonstrated that using SVR-based models, Landsat and MODIS data could be used for long-term DO retrieval at multiple spatial and temporal scales. As data-driven models, combining spectrum and water temperature as well as extending the training set to cover more DO conditions could effectively improve model robustness and generalization.},

   abstract = {Food insecurity continues to grow in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In 2019, chronically malnourished people numbered nearly 240 million, or 20% of the population in SSA. Globally, numerous efforts have been made to anticipate potential droughts, crop conditions, and food shortages in order to improve early warning and risk management for food insecurity. To support this goal, we develop an Earth Observation (EO) and machine-learning-based operational, subnational maize yield forecast system and evaluate its out-of-sample forecast skills during the growing seasons for Kenya, Somalia, Malawi, and Burkina Faso. In general, forecast skills improve substantially during the vegetative growth period (VP) and gradually during the reproductive development period (RP). Thus, mid-season assessment can provide effective early warning months before harvest. Skillful forecasts (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) < 20%) appear approximately two dekads after the VP; for example, skillful forecasts appear in May in Kenya and Somalia, January in Malawi, and July in Burkina Faso. During model development, effective EO features are also identified, such as precipitation and available water during VP, and dry days and extreme temperatures in early VP. Compared to monthly standard EO features, sub-monthly (dekadal), non-standard, and serial EO features significantly improve forecast skills by ＋ 0.3 NSE and -10% of MAPE, demonstrating the ability to precisely and effectively capture favorable or detrimental crop development conditions. Finally, skillful forecasts and practical utility are demonstrated in the recent normal and dry years in each region. Overall, the developed yield forecasting system can provide skillful predictions during the growing season, supporting regional and international agricultural decision-making processes, including informing food-security planning and management, thereby helping to mitigate food shortages caused by unfavorable climate conditions.},

Existing literature has revealed the UHI characteristics and driving factors at an urban scale, but interactions between the main factors of a global grid scale assessment on the context of climate zones remain unclear. Therefore, based on the multidimensional climatic and socio-economic statistical datasets, the multi-time scale of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHI) characteristics was investigated in this study to analyze how natural-anthropogenic drivers affect the variance of SUHI and vary in their importance for the changes of other interaction factors. The results show that the mean value of SUHI in summer is higher than in winter, and in daytime is higher than in nighttime on a seasonal and daily scale. SUHIs in different global climate zones have significant differences. When analyzing drivers’ contributions and interactions with LightGBM model and SHAP algorithm, we know that monthly precipitation (PREC), the estimated population (POP) and surface pressure (PRES) are the three major drivers of daytime SUHI. The nighttime SUHI is mainly PREC, POP and anthropogenic heat emission (AHE), the influence rules of the natural driversare mostly opposite to that of daytime. This study highlights the fundamental role of background climate for designing strategies. Irrigation or artificial rainfall will be effective to mitigate SUHI in low rainfall areas, while it is more effective to reduce AHE in high rainfall areas. In where greening can be difficult in the most developed cities, reducing AHE, increasing per capita GDP and controlling the population scale may also contribute to alleviating the SUHI. This study provides ideas for developing responsive urban heat island mitigation policies in a more realistic setting.},

As an alternative to this, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-prototypical network fusion model based on few-shot learning is proposed, where the strong learning ability of LSTM and the low data dependence of prototypical network are combined. The proposed model was calibrated and implemented on monthly runoff prediction in the Lancang River basin (LRB) and the source region of the Yellow River basin (SRYRB). Compared with eight state-of-the-art data driven models (LSTM, SVR, ANN, ARMA, Random Forest, SimpleRNN, GRU, and BiLSTM), the proposed model outperformed especially when less training data were used. Results in the LRB indicate NSE of the proposed model achieved 0.802 and 0.832 when the proportion of training data (K) was 20% and 45%, improved by 0.527 and 0.222 relative to the mean NSE of other models, respectively. In the SRYRB, NSE reached 0.830 and improved by 0.354 when K was 40%. The findings imply that the new few-shot learning model provides a promising tool for runoff prediction in the two investigated basins and possibly other data-scarce basins where precipitation dominates runoff change, which will benefit regional water resources management and water security.},

Regionalization approaches, hydrological models and machine learning techniques have been used to estimate runoff. However, returning some simplicity to the predictions might be necessary for practical uses. In this paper, we re-introduce C. E. Grunsky approach, developed in the early 1900s to predict runoff from values of precipitation on a two-equations system. Here, we analyze the Grunsky generalized method applied for 716 Brazilian catchments, on an interannual and monthly scales. First, we established the best method to find the rainfall-runoff relation coefficient for each catchment. Then, we evaluate the performance of the method on a local scale, i.e., catchment by catchment. Lastly, we analyze the method of regionalization, by grouping the catchments into six hydrologically similar classes. For local scale, the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values range from 0.87 to 0.93 on the interannual scale and is greater than 0.50 on the monthly scale. For the regionalized approach, KGE varies from 0.60 to 0.84 on an interannual scale. We also found suitable KGE values on a monthly scale, with more than 22% of catchments with KGE greater than 0.50, being the best performances in the Non-seasonal and Extremely-wet groups, and the worst performance in the Dry group. Our findings indicate that Grunsky approach is suitable to predict streamflow for Brazilian catchments on interannual and monthly scales. This simple and easy-to-use equation presents a reliable alternative to more complex methods to compute runoff by only using rainfall data.},

Therefore, in this paper, 617 air quality monitoring sites in central and eastern China are used as examples. First, the five meteorological elements of wind speed (WIN), temperature (TEM), precipitation (PRE), pressure (PRS), relative humidity (RHU) and zenith wet delay (ZWD) data were interpolated to the air quality monitoring sites (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, CO) by the inverse distance interpolation (IDW) method. Secondly, the density distribution of each factor was analyzed, and the monthly mean value of each site was interpolation mapped to observe the overall change trend of PM2.5 in the central and eastern regions, and then Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the relevant factors for modelling. Finally, four models of back propagation (BP) neural network, random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and long and short-term memory network (LSTM) were constructed to predict the change of PM2.5 concentration at each air quality monitoring station for the next week (7 days), half month (15 days) and month (30 days), selecting the model with the best applicability at each time scale, and mapping the prediction results of stations with R2 greater than 0.5 in the model through spatial interpolation for spatial and temporal mapping. The results show that: (1) except for the differences between the density distribution trends of TEM, PRS and RHU and PM2.5, the remaining elements are consistent with the PM2.5 change trends, and the PM2.5 concentrations in the central-eastern region are high in winter (January, February and December) and low in summer (June, July and August), with a spatial distribution of high in the central-west and low in the east; (2) through the evaluation of the index results, it can be seen that in the three time scales of PM2.5 concentration prediction, RF has better applicability compared with the three models of BP, SVR and LSTM, among which the model accuracy is the best in predicting the future week; (3) By comparing the model interpolation results with the original data interpolation results, it can be seen that the results obtained from the model interpolation basically fit the spatial and temporal trends of future PM2.5 concentrations, and the best interpolation results in predicting the future week, the highest reliability of the spatial and temporal mapping results, and more accurate description of the future PM2.5 concentration changes.},

These statements are consistent across different lead times and target month (i.e., March or July).

Of all the various hazards, drought prediction is challenging as it lacks a universal definition and is getting adverse with climate change impacting drought events both spatially and temporally. The problem becomes more complex as drought occurrence is dependent on a multitude of factors ranging from hydro-meteorological to climatic variables. A paradigm shift happened in this field when it was found that the inclusion of climatic variables in the data-driven prediction model improves the accuracy. However, this understanding has been primarily using statistical metrics used to measure the model accuracy. The present work tries to explore this finding using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model. The explainable deep learning model development and comparative analysis were performed using known understandings drawn from physical-based models. The work also tries to explore how the model achieves specific results at different spatio-temporal intervals, enabling us to understand the local interactions among the predictors for different drought conditions and drought periods. The drought index used in the study is Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) at 12 month scales applied for five different regions in New South Wales, Australia, with the explainable algorithm being SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The conclusions drawn from SHAP plots depict the importance of climatic variables at a monthly scale and varying ranges of annual scale. We observe that the results obtained from SHAP align with the physical model interpretations, thus suggesting the need to add climatic variables as predictors in the prediction model.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the phenology of spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus) in the Dinaric mountain forests of southwestern Slovenia. The study of I. typographus took place from 1986 to 2000, while that of P. chalcographus took place from 1993 to 2000 in an area characterized as a Dinaric Fir-Beech forest community (Abieti-Fagetum dinaricum) on the Karst plateau (447–751m above sea level). On the studied area Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been planted between 60 and 90 years ago on approximately 1000ha. Frequent catastrophic weather conditions are characteristic for this area, followed by an increased trophic capacity of the forest for the various bark beetle species. The population density of spruce bark beetles was monitored at five locations at varying exposures using commercial pheromones (Pheroprax® and Chalcoprax®) in traps under the trade name Theysohn. Both species studied (I. typographus and P. chalcographus) have a relatively high abundance and have two main generations per year; both species may also produce two sister generations. Data on some environmental factors as well as data on bark beetle catches have been collected and then analyzed to model the dependence of spruce bark beetle catches on the environmental factors. The machine learning methodology of liner regression as well as model tree induction was used for this purpose. The following attributes were used to analyze the occurrence of both species of bark beetle: position (NW, NE, W, E, N and S), age of pheromone, number of days since last monitoring, average monthly temperature, monthly precipitation, month and previous number of bark beetles. There was a strong correlation between a high population density of I. typograpus and Northeast (NE) and position and a high density of populations of P. chalcographus and West (W) and North (N) positions.},

   abstract = {The current study proposes a new method to downscale the monthly GRACE-derived Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) to 10 km spatial resolution over Iran using deep learning methods. First, the growing neural gas (GNG) method is utilized to cluster the TWSA data to find similar patterns. The Silhouette Chou Davies (SCD) validity measure, a combination of three robust cluster validity measures, is used to evaluate the performance of the GNG method. Then, the feasibility of deep learning Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), shallow learning Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), and Random Forest (RF) are examined in downscaling GRACE-derived TWSA using only remote sensing images. The results indicate that the deep learning method outperforms the RF and FFNN models by 7 % and 18 %, respectively. Then, the Ground Water Storage (GWS) data are isolated from TWSA, showing an agreement between the GRACE-derived GWS and ground-based measurements with R2 = 0.76. Additionally, the downscaled TWSA is used to generate annual drought frequency and change detection maps for the GWS from 2002 to 2016. Annual standardized precipitation index (SPI) drought frequency maps are also produced to gain deeper insight into the water resource scarcity of Iran. The results indicate that Iran has experienced water resource overexploitation since 2011 for agricultural activities, while meteorological drought is a trigger and intensifier for the water crisis in Iran. According to the results, Iran experienced exceptional drought in some regions, and the GWS has decreased all over the country. In addition, further analysis of Iran’s water resources is provided until 2022. The current study calls for integrated sustainable water resources management in Iran; otherwise, irreversible water and environmental problems with higher frequencies will be expected in the near future.},

   abstract = {Satellites with microwave-based sensors are launched to study and estimate global precipitation due to the instrument's sensitivity to precipitation, as well as their global coverage. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) mission jointly launched by NASA of US and JAXA of Japan to study the global rain within the tropics had two microwave-based instruments on board; the Precipitation Radar (PR) and the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI). Radar, being an active instrument, measures rainfall by detecting the echo accurately over both land and oceans. On the other hand, the passive instrument, radiometer, senses radiation emerging from the land/ocean surface, passing through the raining atmosphere. Due to the absence of contrast over land pixels, radiometers do not perform well over land surfaces in the detection of rainfall. Hence, over land rain screening algorithms are predominantly based on high-frequency channels which are sensitive to the scattering of radiation. However, their performance in screening the pixel for rain is based on threshold values. The present study demonstrates a superior algorithm powered by machine learning (ML) techniques. We apply the artificial neural network (ANN) and the random forest algorithm for screening the pixels over land for rainfall. The algorithms are trained with TMI measured brightness temperatures, while the TRMM PR detected rain flag is used as the truth. The ML models were trained with 2012 JJAS data over the Indian landmass. The performance of the ML models is tested with the monthly data of 2012 and with the 2013 JJAS dataset over the same region to demonstrate the robustness of the model. The imbalance of the dataset (a small fraction of rain cases as compared to no-rain cases) has been addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A comparison is made between the two ML algorithms against the GPROF algorithm, which is implemented in the operational data product for the TRMM version 7 data product. Results show that the ML-based methods performed better as compared to the GPROF. On the 2013 JJAS dataset, the maximum F1 score obtained was 0.65 for the actual dataset, while the score with oversampled dataset was 0.68. For the same dataset, the GPROF algorithm showed an F1 score of 0.59. Apart from the nine brightness temperatures as input, new derived features were also selected based on two feature selection methods: mutual information and analysis of variance. It was seen that the models' performance on the two feature sets obtained from the two methods were very much similar.},

   abstract = {Context Prediction of days suitable for fieldwork is important for understanding the potential effects of climate change and for selecting machinery systems to improve efficiency in field operations and avoid soil damage. Yet, we lack predictive models to inform decision-making at scale. Objective We filled this knowledge gap by developing and testing five new workability models. Methods One model follows soil moisture-based methods (APSIM), one uses simple rain and temperature thresholds, and three follow machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Decision Table, Neural Network). We parameterized the models using USDA survey data from Iowa, USA and evaluated their temporal and spatial prediction over twelve US Corn Belt States and different time periods using multiple statistical indexes and sensitivity analysis. The models operate at a 5-arcminute resolution. Results and conclusions Results indicated that the simple rule model, the Decision Table model, and the process-based model predicted field workable days with an agreement index of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.84, respectively for the testing datasets (n = 22,671), and hence were deemed sufficient for future use. The selected models are better suited for large timespan evaluations of workability (monthly to annual, normalized root mean square error, nRMSE = 8 to 15%)) than weekly predictions (nRMSE = 21%). The machine learning models tended to cluster their predictions around a mean value and were about 50% less responsive to precipitation than the process-based or rule-based models. We concluded that simple approaches are more robust to be applied at scale than complex approaches with many data input requirements. Significance The developed models enhance our capacity to predict climate change impacts on workability, a valuable indicator for decision-making and overall sustainability.},

However, data collection is very difficult and costly in undeveloped countries. Therefore, obtaining a general model and using less input data is the key to popularizing the application of machine learning models for estimating groundwater levels. This study evaluated the potential of the kernel-based nonlinear extension of the Arps decline model (KNEA), long short-term memory network (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for accurately estimating GWL in the Hetao Irrigation District in China. All models were developed using monthly records from 143 monitoring wells between 1990 and 2015. Eight input combinations (including the one-month prior GWL, air temperature, global solar radiation, precipitation and amount of irrigation) were applied to explore the possibility of improving model accuracy using less input data. In addition, the general performance of the models was evaluated by cross validation. The results showed that the KNEA model was superior to the LSTM and GRU models for all input combinations using the local application. For cross-district application, the average statistical results indicated that the LSTM (RMSE = 0.45 m and R2 = 0.78) and GRU (RMSE = 0.48 m and R2 = 0.76) models performed better than the KNEA model (RMSE = 0.70 m and R2 = 0.62), and the LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and stability. For input data, these three models had difficulty obtaining satisfactory monthly GWLs using meteorological and irrigation data without pervious GWL data. Adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical GWL greatly improved the accuracy of the models. Compared with PREC and GSR, adding temperature input had the best improvement. However, adding large-scale average irrigation data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the models. In addition, the LSTM model and input data of the historical GWLs and temperature were recommended in arid and semiarid agricultural areas with limited data.},

   abstract = {Drought forewarning is an important decisive task since drought is perceived a recurrent feature of climate variability and climate change leading to catastrophic consequences for agriculture, ecosystem sustainability, and food and water scarcity. This study designs and evaluates a soft-computing drought modelling framework in context of Pakistan, a drought-stricken nation, by means of a committee extreme learning machine (Comm-ELM) model in respect to a committee particle swarm optimization-adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (Comm-PSO-ANFIS) and committee multiple linear regression (Comm-MLR) model applied to forecast monthly standardized precipitation index (SPI). The proposed Comm-ELM model incorporates historical monthly rainfall, temperature, humidity, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) at monthly lag (t − 1) and the respective month (i.e., periodicity factor) as the explanatory variable for the drought’s behaviour defined by SPI. The model accuracy is assessed by root mean squared error, mean absolute error, correlation coefficient, Willmott’s index, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Legates McCabe’s index in the independent test dataset. With the incorporation of periodicity as an input factor, the performance of the Comm-ELM model for Islamabad, Multan and Dera Ismail Khan (D. I. Khan) as the test stations, was remarkably improved in respect to the Comm-PSO-ANFIS and Comm-MLR model. Other than the superiority of Comm-ELM over the alternative models tested for monthly SPI forecasting, we also highlight the importance of the periodicity cycle as a pertinent predictor variable in a drought forecasting model. The results ascertain that the model accuracy scales with geographic factors, due to the complexity of drought phenomenon and its relationship with the different inputs and data attributes that can affect the overall evolution of a drought event. The findings of this study has important implications for agricultural decision-making where future knowledge of drought can be used to develop climate risk mitigation strategies for better crop management.},

   abstract = {Precipitation is essential for crop production, water resource management, and other activities. Since precipitation has unpredictable sequential and seasonal characteristics, it is extremely difficult to forecast precipitation. Hence, a better forecasting model will lead to an early warning that minimizes the risk to life and property. Many approaches, such as statistical, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and hybrid algorithms, are used to build precipitation forecasting systems. Feature selection is especially important for selecting past values (lags) and to eliminate irrelevant and/or redundant features. The optimization algorithm helps identify correct time series lags because it does not make data assumptions. In this work, a hybrid long-term (1-month ahead) precipitation forecast model (ABR-LSO) is proposed by integrating the AdaBoostRegressor (ABR) with the Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) algorithm. Time series precipitation data for the period 1989–2019 for Idukki, Kerala, India. The ABR model considered 12 antecedent rainfall records as its input features and predicted the rainfall data for the next time step (t + 1), whereas the ABR-LSO hybrid model optimized the input features with LSO. The efficacy of the forecast models is evaluated using statistical indices like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). It has been noted that in models 1, 2, and 3, the LSO-ABR model produced good MAE above ABR model improvements of 5.08 %, 4 %, and 6.12 %, respectively. Precipitation forecasts will help the administrators devise disaster prevention mechanisms against flooding in the downstream areas.},

   abstract = {Cattle ranching has increased globally in the last decades, and although pasture expansion is well documented across different regions, there is little understanding of the intensity at which cattle operate in these areas. With freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, we mapped for the first time polyethylene silage bags used for forage conservation in a year with the Random Forest algorithm, and proposed them as a spatial indicator of cattle intensity. For this, we combined monthly silage area with land cover and climatic variables in a regression framework to understand cattle intensity metrics at regional and farm scales throughout 20 million hectares in the Dry Chaco. In addition, we explored the impact of using maize silage supplementation on productive and environmental metrics at the farm scale in a precipitation gradient. We validated our models using a spatially explicit database of cattle distribution. Our results highlight that silage bags are accurate mappable objects with Sentinel-2, which can contribute to the understanding of cattle density, and heifer and steer density in pasture contexts at farm and regional scales. Finally, our whole-farm simulations support the idea that incorporating silage supplementation in cattle ranching regional analyses conducts to significant differences on environmental or productive estimations, which should be considered. The amount of stored forage that is used in supplementation has strong implications for the performance of cattle ranching, but remains difficult to quantify at the regional level with remote sensing. Silage bag mapping is thus an opportunity to improve the overall understanding of livestock intensification and its productive and environmental impacts, particularly in highly seasonal rangelands. Following this metric could be a valuable indicator of the cattle ranching performance in terms of it resilience, production increase and impacts over natural ecosystems (related to Sustainable Development Goal 2-zero hunger and also in the 15-life on land).},

   abstract = {In recent years, due to the influence of human activities and changing climate conditions, precipitation time series have had increasing non-stationarity and randomness. Therefore, the scientific and accurate prediction of precipitation has become increasingly difficult. To improve precipitation prediction accuracy, nonlinear precipitation data was decomposed into several subcomponents via three decomposition methods (time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD), wavelet transform (WT), and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD)). Then, the Elman neural network (ENN) was used to construct TVF-EMD-ENN, WT-ENN, and CEEMD-ENN models to predict the subcomponents of precipitation. Finally, these three models were applied to the monthly and daily precipitation series from different meteorological stations. The results showed that TVF-EMD-ENN made relatively stable predictions for monthly and daily precipitation, and was better than WT-ENN, CEEMD-ENN, and other models. Predictions for Turpan station were generally poor, likely due to the discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices. Overall, the predictions by TVF-EMD-ENN were better, which was clearly reflected in the variance contribution rates (VCR) of high-frequency subcomponents, which were lower than those of WT and CEEMD. Parameter sensitivities of TVF-EMD indicated that the bandwidth threshold (BT) and the b-spline order (BSO) had a strong influence on model performance, and that BT and BSO should remain within 0.15–0.50 and 15–65, respectively. This study has provided a new approach to precipitation prediction that is better equipped to handle non-stationarity and randomness.},

Seven investigated features, obtained from Google Earth Engine, were used in the ML/DL modeling (soil moisture, PDSI, precipitation, evapotranspiration, elevation, slope and soil texture). The temporal ARIMA model (found most suitable for local scale prediction) and the multi-features RF model (more suitable for national-scale prediction) emerged as best performing for soil moisture prediction (with MAE of 9.1 and 11.95, and R2 of 0.79 and 0.59, respectively). All models generally performed better in predicting the soil moisture than the PDSI indicator of drought. For drought indicator prediction and mapping, previous-year average monthly soil moisture emerged as the most important feature, combined with the four additional corresponding features of PDSI, precipitation, evapotranspiration and elevation.},

Indonesia possesses the largest share (65 %) of tropical peat carbon, equal to 57.4 Gt C. Human perturbations such as extensive logging, deforestation and canalization exacerbate water losses, especially during dry seasons, when low precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates combine with the increased drainage to lower groundwater levels. Drying and increasing temperatures of the surface peat exacerbate ignition and wildfire risks within the peat soils. As such, it is critically important to know how groundwater levels in peatlands are changing over space and time. In this study, a multilinear regression model as well as two machine learning algorithms, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, were used to model groundwater level over the study period (2010−12) within a peat dome impacted by drainage canals and multiple wildfires in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Although all three models performed well, based on overall fit, spatial modeling of groundwater level results revealed that extreme gradient boosting (R2 = 0.998, RMSE = 0.048 m) outperformed random forest (R2 = 0.997, RMSE = 0.054 m) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.970, RMSE = 0.221 m) near drainage canals, which are key fire ignition risk locations in the peatlands. Our study also shows that, on average, elevation and precipitation are the most important parameters influencing groundwater level spatiotemporally.},

   abstract = {Study Region Lake Bracciano has been historically used as a strategic water reservoir for the city of Rome (Italy) since ancient times. However, following the severe water crisis of 2017, water abstraction has been completely stopped. Study Focus The relative impact of the various drivers of change (climatological and management) on fluctuations in lake water level is not yet clear. To quantify this impact, we applied the Random Forest (RF) machine learning approach, taking advantage of a century of observations. New Hydrological Insights for the Region Since the late 1990s the monthly variation in lake water levels has doubled, as has variation in monthly abstraction. Increased variation in annual cumulated precipitation and a rise in mean air temperature have also been observed. The RF machine learning approach made it possible to confirm the marginal role of temperature, the increasing role of abstraction during the last two decades (from 24 % to 39 %), and the key role played by the increased precipitation variability. These results highlight the notable prediction and inference capabilities of RF in a complex and partially unknown hydrological context. We conclude by discussing the limits of this approach, which are mainly associated with its capacity to generates scenarios compared to physical based models.},

   abstract = {Daily maximum temperature can be used a good indicator of peak energy consumption, since it can be used to predict the massive use of heating or air conditioning systems. Thus, the prediction of daily maximum temperature is an important problem with interesting applications in the energy field, since it has been proven that electricity demand depends much on weather conditions. This paper presents a novel methodology for daily maximum temperature prediction, based on a Support Vector Regression approach. The paper is focused on different measuring stations in Europe, from which different meteorological variables have been obtained, including temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and air pressure. Two more variables are also included, specifically synoptic situation of the day and monthly cycle. Using this pool of prediction variables, it is shown that the SVMr algorithm is able to give an accurate prediction of the maximum temperature 24 h later. In the paper SVMr technique applied is fully described, including some bounds on the machine hyper-parameters in order to speed up the SVMr training process. The performance of the SVMr has been compared to that of different neural networks in the literature: a Multi-layer perceptron and an Extreme Learning Machine.},

We evaluated the performance of eleven state-of-the-art P products and seven ETa products over the Nile Basin using a four-step procedure: (i) P products were evaluated at the monthly scale through a point-to-pixel approach; (ii) streamflow was modelled using the Random Forest machine learning technique, and simulated for well-performing catchments for 2009–2018 (to correspond with ETa product availability); (iii) ETa products were evaluated at the multiannual scale using the water balance method; and (iv) the ability of the best-performing P and ETa products to represent monthly variations in terrestrial water storage (ΔTWS) was assessed through a comparison with GRACE Level-3 data. New hydrological insights for the region CHIRPSv2 was the best-performing P product (median monthly KGE’ of 0.80) and PMLv2 and WaPORv2.1 the best-performing ETa products over the majority of the evaluated catchments. The application of the water balance using these best-performing products captures the seasonality of ΔTWS well over the White Nile Basin, but overestimates seasonality over the Blue Nile Basin. Our study demonstrates how gridded P and ETa products can be evaluated over extremely data-scarce conditions using an easily transferable methodology.},

   abstract = {Drought hazard is one of the main consequences of global warming and climate change. Unlike other natural disasters, drought has complex climatic features. Therefore, accurate drought monitoring is a challenging task. This paper proposes a framework for assessing drought classifications at the regional level. The proposed framework provides a new drought monitoring indicator called Multi-Scalar Seasonally Amalgamated Regional Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (MSARSPEI). MSARSPEI is an amalgam of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration (SPEI) (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010) and Regionally Improved Weighted Standardized Drought Index (RIWSDI) (Jiang et al., 2020). In the proposed framework, the Boruta algorithm of feature selection is configured to ensemble monthly time series data of evaporation in various meteorological stations located in specific regions. Further, the framework suggests the standardization of the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of K-Component Gaussian (K-CG) mixture distribution function for obtaining MSARSPEI data. The application of the proposed framework is based on seven different regions of Pakistan. For comparative analysis, this paper compared the performance of MSARSPE with SPEI using Pearson correlation. Outcomes associated with this research show that the proposed regional drought index has a strong correlation with the competing indicator in various time scales. In addition, the study assessed the spatial extent of various drought classifications under MSARSPEI. In summation, this research concludes that the choice of the MSARSPEI is rationally valid and more appropriate for the regional assessment of drought under the global warming scenario.},

The stacked generalization ensemble consists of multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) combined through a meta-learning algorithm with/without rescanning input covariates. Sixteen input covariates, including 2 topographic features, 5 cloud properties, 5 environmental variables, 3 precipitation products (PPs), and inverse distance weighted (IDW) estimates as the precipitation background field were fed into the machine learning models. Hold out approach was adopted for performance evaluation in which 50% of the 174 gauges were used for training, and the rest was used for validation. The results indicated that the overall monthly MAE, RMSE, and rBias of the proposed stacking model for the validation dataset were 3.3%, 6.8%, and 50%, respectively, less than that of the RF model, which is the best individual model. Also, the stacking model outperformed LWLR by decreasing monthly MAE, RMSE, and rBias 10.7%, 19.1%, and 28.6%, respectively. Further analysis implied that (1) the stacked model is more robust than LWLR and less dependent on the density of gauges, thus suitable for areas with scarce gauge coverage; (2) comparing the spatial distribution of mean monthly precipitation maps, generated by stacking and LWLR models, stacking algorithm can successfully screen out the bulls' eyes of background IDW precipitation field, and both patterns are consistent with the topography of the area; and (3) the stacking scheme is found to have a better extrapolation ability than LWLR over high elevations.},

Machine learning (ML) techniques, as an increasingly popular approach, have been applied in diverse climatic regions, showing their respective superiority. On top of that, the ensemble learning model that synthesizes the advantages of different ML models deserves more attention. In this study, an ensemble learning model based on stacking approach was proposed. Four prevalent ML models, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) are taken as base models. To combine the outputs from the base models, the weighting algorithm is used as second-layer learner to generate predictions. Large-scale climate indices, large-scale atmospheric variables, and local meteorological variables were used as predictors. R2, RMSE and MAE, were used as evaluation metrics. The results show that the performance of base models varied among the nine stations in the Taihu Basin, while the stacking approach generally performed better than the four base models. The stacking model showed better performance in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. During wet months, the accuracy of model prediction varied more significantly. On the whole, based on performance evaluation measures, it is concluded that the proposed stacking ensemble multi-ML model can provide a flexible and reasonable prediction framework applicable to other regions.</p>},

One regression model autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and five state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks, support vector machine, random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression, and dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network, were implemented for monthly rainfall prediction over 25 stations in the East China region. The results showed that the ML models outperformed ARIMA model, and RF relatively outperformed other models. Local meteorological variables, humidity, and sunshine duration, were the most important predictors in improving prediction accuracy. 4-month lagged Western North Pacific Monsoon had higher importance than other large-scale climatic variables. The overall output of rainfall prediction was scalable and could be readily generalized to other regions.},

For time series data forecasting, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is shown to be superior as compared to other machine learning algorithms. Therefore, in this research work, a LSTM network is developed to predict daily average rainfall values using meteorological data obtained from the Malaysian Meteorological Department for Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. Six daily meteorology data, namely, minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), mean temperature (°C), mean wind speed (m/s), mean sea level pressure (hPa) and mean relative humidity (%) from the year 2009 to 2013 were used as the input of the LSTM prediction model. The accuracy of the predicted daily average rainfall was assessed using coefficient determinant (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Contrary to the common practice of dividing the whole available data set into training, validation and testing sub-sets, the developed LSTM model in this study was applied to forecast the daily average rainfall for the month December 2013 while training was done using the data prior of this month. An analysis on the testing data showed that, the data is more spread out in the testing set as compared to the training data. As LSTM requires the right setting of hyper-parameters, an analysis on the effects of the number of maximum epochs and the mini-batch size on the rainfall prediction accuracy were carried out in this study. From the experiments, a five layers LSTM model with number of maximum epoch of 10 and mini-batch size of 100 managed to achieve the best prediction at an average RMSE of 20.67 mm and R2 = 0.82.},

Machine learning models are increasingly used for flood forecasting, however, they are limited in their ability to extract effective features from rainfall data and capture dynamic runoff processes. This study proposes an attention mechanism-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, named as ALSTM-DW, which uses double time sliding windows (DTSW), and a weighted mean square error (WMSE) loss function. The ALSTM-DW model was applied to three urban flooding hotspots in Shenzhen, China, and its effectiveness was verified through a series of comparative experiments. The results obtained show that: 1) the proposed model performs well, with a coefficient of determination larger than 0.85, peak flow error smaller than 0.015 m, and time to peak error smaller than 2 min on average in testing periods; 2) the use of DTSW helps extract effective rainfall features and mitigate excessive fluctuations in forecasted hydrographs caused by overresponse to rainfall; 3) adding the attention mechanism to the LSTM network helps consider the varying contribution of each input factor over time; and 4) the WMSE improves the ability of the network to predict flood peaks, with an average decrease of 88% and 54% in peak flow error and time to peak error, respectively. Therefore, the ALSTM-DW model shows promising potential for providing accurate flood forecasting, which can support effective flood emergency operations.},

The determined explanatory variables are then used for training RVM-based statistical downscaling model. A least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM)-based downscaling model is also constructed to compare the downscaling performance of RVM through some performance evaluation measures such as R-2, AdjR(2) and RMS error (RMSE). Because RVM is able to obtain the better modeling accuracy in terms of all performance measures during the testing period, third-generation coupled climate model (CGCM3) simulations run through the trained RVM to obtain future scenario results. The effectiveness of the RVM model is illustrated through its integration to climate scenarios (20C3M and A2). The statistical significance of the probable changes obtained with used methods is examined by Mann-Whitney U (M-W) and t-tests considering scenario forecasts.

The development of satellite sensors and remote sensing technology has resulted in multi-source precipitation datasets that provide reliable estimates of precipitation over un-gauged areas. However, gaps exist over high latitude areas due to the limited spatial extent of several satellite-based precipitation products. In this study, we propose an approach for the reconstruction of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 monthly precipitation data over Northeast China based on the interaction between precipitation and surface environment. Two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF), are implemented to detect possible relationships between precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and digital elevation model (DEM). The relationships between precipitation and geographical location variations based on longitude and latitude are also considered in the reconstruction model. The reconstruction of monthly precipitation in the study area is conducted in two spatial resolutions (25 km and 1 km). The validation is performed using in-situ observations from eight meteorological stations within the study area. The results show that the RF algorithm is robust and not sensitive to the choice of parameters, while the training accuracy of the SVM algorithm has relatively large fluctuations depending on the parameter settings and month. The precipitation data reconstructed with RF show strong correlation with in situ observations at each station and are more accurate than that obtained using the SVM algorithm. In general, the accuracy of the estimated precipitation at 1 km resolution is slightly lower than that of data at 25 km resolution. The estimation errors are positively related to the average precipitation.},

For the nonlinear problem in forecasting precipitation time series, a hybrid prediction model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) coupled with extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to reduce the difficulty in modeling monthly precipitation forecasting and improve the prediction accuracy. The monthly precipitation data in the past 60 years from Yan'an City and Huashan Mountain, Shaanxi Province, are used as cases to test this new hybrid model. First, the nonstationary monthly precipitation time series are decomposed into several relatively stable intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using VMD. Then, an ELM prediction model is established for each IMF. Next, the predicted values of these components are accumulated to obtain the final prediction results. Finally, three predictive indicators are adopted to measure the prediction accuracy of the proposed hybrid model, back propagation (BP) neural network, Elman neural network (Elman), ELM, and EMD-ELM models: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental simulation results show that the proposed hybrid model has higher prediction accuracy and can be used to predict the monthly precipitation time series.},

In this study, the prediction accuracy of new heuristic methods, optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5Tree), is examined in modeling monthly streamflows using precipitation and temperature inputs. Data collected from Kalam and Chakdara stations at a mountainous basin, Swat River Basin, Pakistan are utilized as case study. The prediction accuracy of all four methods are validated and tested using four different input scenarios and evaluated using combined accuracy (CA), a newly used criterion in addition to root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The test results of both stations show that the LSSVM and MARS-based models provide more accurate prediction results compared to OP-ELM and M5Tree models. LSSVM decreases the RMSE of the MARS, OP-ELM and M5Tree by 9.12%, 25.64% and 35.15% for the Kalam station while the RMSEs of the LSSVM, OP-ELM and M5Tree is decreased by 2.12%, 34.81% and 32.52% using MARS, for the Chakdara Station, respectively. It is observed that the monthly streamflows of Kalam Station can be successfully predicted using only temperature data. Only precipitation inputs also provide good accuracy for Kalam Station while they produce inaccurate predictions for the Chakdara Station. The prediction capabilities of the applied methods are also examined in estimating streamflow of downstream station using upstream data. The results prove the dominancy of LSSVM and MARS-based models over OP-ELM and M5Tree in prediction streamflow data without local input data. Heuristic methods are also compared with stochastic method of seasonal auto regressive moving average (SARIMA). The OP-ELM, LSSVM, MARS perform superior to the SARIMA in monthly streamflow prediction.

Cross-validation is used to reconstruct 36 years of daily rainfall data at 17 gauges. Prediction is independent for each gauge. The reconstructed series are compared with the observed records in order to select the optimal hyperparameters within each family of models. The predictive performance of the models is evaluated using several metrics and statistics related with rainfall intensity and occurrence at daily, monthly and annual aggregation scales. Multivariate and univariate analysis of variance are used to evaluate the differences among models. The results of our work demonstrate that the performance of most machine learning models is very sensitive to the selected hyperparameters. Neural networks are found to perform best to predict rainfall occurrence and intensity. All methods underestimate the variance of the observed series at daily time scales. Generalized linear models using gamma-distributed errors perform best for predicting rainfall extremes, however, their performance limits its practical applications. Results improve significatively at larger temporal aggregations (monthly or annual) making statistical and machine learning methods more valuable for water resources studies.},

   abstract = {Hybrid models that combine wavelet transformation (WT) as a pre-processing tool with data-driven models (DDMs) as modeling approaches have been widely investigated for forecasting streamflow. The WT approach has been applied to original time series for decomposing processes prior to the application of DDM modeling. This procedure has been applied to eliminate redundant patterns or information that lead to a dramatic increase in the model performance. In this study, three experiments were implemented, including stand-alone data-driven modeling, hind cast decomposing using WT divided and entered into the extreme learning machine (ELM), and the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model to forecast streamflow data. The WT method was applied in two forms: discrete and continuous (DWT and CWT). In this paper, a new hybrid model is proposed based on an integrative prediction model where XGB is used as an input selection tool for the importance attributes of the prediction matrix that are then supplied to the ELM model as a predictive model. The monthly streamflow, upstream flow, rainfall, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration of a basin named in 1805 and located in the south east of Turkey, are used for development of the model. The modeling results show that applying the WT method improved the performance in the hindcast experiment based on the CWT form with minimum root mean square error (RMSE = 4.910 m(3)/s). On the contrary, WT deteriorated the performance of the forecasting and the stand-alone models exhibited a better performance. WT increased the performance of the hindcast experiment due to the inclusion of future information caused by convolution of the time series. However, the forecast experiment experienced deterioration due to the border effect at the end of the time series. Hence, WT was found not to be a useful pre-processing technique in forecasting the streamflow.},

   abstract = {Accurate precipitation forecasts are much attractive due to their complexity. This study aimed to use the hybrid Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model and machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to improve precipitation forecasts. Time variation analysis and time series decomposition were the two concepts applied to construct the hybrid models. The performance of the two concepts was evaluated with monthly precipitation time series of two stations in northern Iran. Time variation analysis of time series was conducted with the clustering analysis, which increased the accuracy of forecasting with 20.99% decrease in the geometric mean error ratio for the two stations. SVM model decreased the forecasted error compared to ANN in the internal process of time variation analysis. Average of Mean Relative Error (MRE) were MRESVM = 0.72, MREANN = 0.89, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the two stations were MAE(SVM) = 18.02 and MAE(ANN) = 23.88. Therefore, SVM outperformed the ANN model. Comparison of the two hybrid models indicated that more accurate results belonged to the concept of time series decomposition (the decrease in root mean square error from time variation to time series decomposition concepts was 13.35%). Extracting the pattern of data with SARIMA-based hybrid model with time series decomposition improved the precipitation forecasting. Configurations related to nonlinear components of time series with time steps of residual had good performance (the average of agreement index was 0.9). The results suggest that the hybrid model can be a valuable and effective tool for decision processes, and time series decomposition to linear and nonlinear components has a better performance.},

   abstract = {Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology.},

For this purpose, firstly 10% random precipitation data were assumed as missing data for the period 1980-2019. Secondly, the missing data in each station was estimated with the data of other stations within the framework of four data combinations scenarios. In Kernel-based SVR and GPR methods, the RBF kernel gave suitable results for the selected study area. While SVR and RF methods gave very close estimation results, the SVR method gave relatively better results than the other methods especially in error minimizing aspects. Gaussian function based GPR model generally tries to estimate missing data closer to means. This is the main disadvantage of the GPR model and therefore it is unsuccessful in the estimation process. Finally, the results showed that the algorithms based on machine learning are successful in estimating the missing precipitation data.},

It is, therefore, crucial to gain insights into the outbreak mechanism of HCBs and understand the spatiotemporal variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in this highly turbid and productive water. This study aims to evaluate the predictable performance of both approaches using satellite band ratio and machine learning for Chl-a concentration retrieval-a proxy of HCBs. The monthly water quality samples collected from 2016 to 2018 and 23 cloud free Sentinel-2A/B scenes were used to develop Chl-a retrieval models. For the band ratio approach, a strong linear relationship with in situ Chl-a was found for two-band algorithm of Green-NIR. The band ratio-based model accounts for 72% of variation in Chl-a concentration from 2016 to 2018 datasets with an RMSE of 5.95 mu g/L. For the machine learning approach, Gaussian process regression (GPR) yielded superior results for Chl-a prediction from water quality parameters with the values of 0.79 (R-2) and 3.06 mu g/L (RMSE). Among various climatic parameters, a high correlation (R-2 = 0.54) between the monthly total precipitation and Chl-a concentration was found. Our analysis also found nitrogen-rich water and TSS in the rainy season as the driving factors of observed HCBs in the eutrophic Tri An Reservoir (TAR), which offer important solutions to the management of HCBs in the future.},

   abstract = {Grape downy mildew (GDM) is a major disease of grapevine that has an impact on both the yields of the vines and the quality of the harvested fruits. The disease is currently controlled by repetitive fungicide treatments throughout the season, especially in the Bordeaux vineyards where the average number of fungicide treatments against GDM was equal to 10.1 in 2013. Reducing the number of treatments is a major issue from both an environmental and a public health point of view. One solution would be to identify vineyards that are likely to be heavily attacked in spring and then apply fungicidal treatments only to these situations. In this perspective, we use here a dataset including 9 years of GDM observations to develop and compare several generalized linear models and machine learning algorithms predicting the probability of high incidence and severity in the Bordeaux region. The algorithms tested use the date of disease onset and/or average monthly temperatures and precipitation as input variables. The accuracy of the tested models and algorithms is assessed by year-by-year cross validation. LASSO, random forest and gradient boosting algorithms show better performance than generalized linear models. The date of onset of the disease has a greater influence on the accuracy of forecasts than weather inputs and, among weather inputs, precipitation has a greater influence than temperature. The best performing algorithm was selected to evaluate the impact of contrasted climate scenarios on GDM risk levels. Results show that risk of GDM at bunch closure decreases with reduced rainfall and increased temperatures in April-May. Our results also show that the use of fungicide treatment decision rules that take into account local characteristics would reduce the number of treatments against GDM in the Bordeaux vineyards compared to current practices by at least 50%.},

   abstract = {Long-term and accurate predictions of regional groundwater hydrology are important for maintaining environmental sustainability in arid agricultural areas that experience seasonal freezing and thawing where serious water-saving measurements are used. In this study, we firstly developed a machine-learning method by integrating a multivariate time series controlled auto-regressive method and the ridge regression method (CAR-RR) for water table depth modeling. We applied and evaluated this model in the Hetao Irrigation District, located in northwest China where the freezing-thawing period is 5 months long. To train and validate the model, we used monthly data of water diversion, precipitation, evaporation, and drainage from 1995 to 2013. The CAR-RR model yielded more accurate results than the support vector regression (SVR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models did in the validation period. To extend the model applicability during freezing-thawing periods, we included additional temperature information. We compared results obtained using temperature only during the freezing-thawing period with results obtained without temperature, which showed that the input data of the temperature during the freezing-thawing period significantly improved the model accuracy. To resolve the problem of capturing the peaks and troughs of CAR-RR, we further developed an integrated CAR-SVR model to consider the nonlinearity. The optimal model (CAR-SVR) was then used to predict the water table depth under future water-saving measurements. It demonstrated that water diversion was the most important factor affecting the water table depth. A water table depth with less than 3.64 billion m(3) water diversion will result in risks of environment problems.},

   abstract = {Featured Application Authors are encouraged to provide a concise description of the specific application or a potential application of the work. This section is not mandatory. Droughts can cause significant damage to agriculture and water resources, leading to severe economic losses and loss of life. One of the most important aspect is to develop effective tools to forecast drought events that could be helpful in mitigation strategies. The understanding of droughts has become more challenging because of the effect of climate change, urbanization and water management; therefore, the present study aims to forecast droughts by determining an appropriate index and analyzing its changes, using climate variables. The work was conducted in three different phases, first being the determination of Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), using global climatic dataset of Climate Research Unit (CRU) from 1901-2018. The indices are calculated at different monthly intervals which could depict short-term or long-term changes, and the index value represents different drought classes, ranging from extremely dry to extremely wet. However, the present study was focused only on forecasting at short-term scales for New South Wales (NSW) region of Australia and was conducted at two different time scales, one month and three months. The second phase involved dividing the data into three sample sizes, training (1901-2010), testing (2011-2015) and validation (2016-2018). Finally, a machine learning approach, Random Forest (RF), was used to train and test the data, using various climatic variables, e.g., rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, cloud cover, vapor pressure and temperature (maximum, minimum and mean). The final phase was to analyze the performance of the model based on statistical metrics and drought classes. Regarding this, the performance of the testing period was conducted by using statistical metrics, Coefficient of Determination (R-2) and Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) method. The performance of the model showed a considerably higher value of R(2)for both the time scales. However, statistical metrics analyzes the variation between the predicted and observed index values, and it does not consider the drought classes. Therefore, the variation in predicted and observed SPEI values were analyzed based on different drought classes, which were validated by using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-based Area under the Curve (AUC) approach. The results reveal that the classification of drought classes during the validation period had an AUC of 0.82 for SPEI 1 case and 0.84 for SPEI 3 case. The study depicts that the Random Forest model can perform both regression and classification analysis for drought studies in NSW. The work also suggests that the performance of any model for drought forecasting should not be limited only through statistical metrics, but also by examining the variation in terms of drought characteristics.},

In this study, the prediction accuracy of new heuristic methods, optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5Tree), is examined in modeling monthly streamflows using precipitation and temperature inputs. Data collected from Kalam and Chakdara stations at a mountainous basin, Swat River Basin, Pakistan are utilized as case study. The prediction accuracy of all four methods are validated and tested using four different input scenarios and evaluated using combined accuracy (CA), a newly used criterion in addition to root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The test results of both stations show that the LSSVM and MARS-based models provide more accurate prediction results compared to OP-ELM and M5Tree models. LSSVM decreases the RMSE of the MARS, OP-ELM and M5Tree by 9.12%, 25.64% and 35.15% for the Kalam station while the RMSEs of the LSSVM, OP-ELM and M5Tree is decreased by 2.12%, 34.81% and 32.52% using MARS, for the Chakdara Station, respectively. It is observed that the monthly streamflows of Kalam Station can be successfully predicted using only temperature data. Only precipitation inputs also provide good accuracy for Kalam Station while they produce inaccurate predictions for the Chakdara Station. The prediction capabilities of the applied methods are also examined in estimating streamflow of downstream station using upstream data. The results prove the dominancy of LSSVM and MARS-based models over OP-ELM and M5Tree in prediction streamflow data without local input data. Heuristic methods are also compared with stochastic method of seasonal auto regressive moving average (SARIMA). The OP-ELM, LSSVM, MARS perform superior to the SARIMA in monthly streamflow prediction. Based on the overall results, the LSSVM and MARS are recommended for monthly streamflow prediction with or without local data.},

The features used to model ETo were the GPM daily data set, WorldClim averages monthly, and two engineered features. Among the machine learning algorithms assessed, the Cubist presented the best performance-computation cost trade-off in a subset of the entire data and, therefore, was selected to model ETo daily. The developed data set presented root mean square error of 0.65 mm day(-1), or 16% lower than previous ETo data set developed for Brazil using interpolation techniques. The GPM and engineered features showed higher importance for the models trained during the wet season, while the WorldClim maximum temperature averages monthly were more important during the dry and cold season.

Researchers, who wish to statistically test hypotheses on the relationship between agro-meteorological and European policy outcomes, often observe that agro-meteorological data is typically stored in gridded and temporally detailed form, while many relevant policy outcomes are only available on an aggregated level. This dataset intends to aid empirical investigations by providing a dataset with monthly meteorological indicators on a European Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics level 3 (NUTS 3) regional level for 13 countries for the period from 1989 to 2018. The data we provide allows researchers to investigate hypothesis related to weather volatility and the probability of extreme weather events. We created this dataset from the daily data in grids of 25 km x 25 km provided by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. We matched the map with the raw data to a map with the administrative boundaries of European NUTS 3 regions. After appropriately weighting, we calculated the monthly, regional mean, variance and kurtosis of the following variables: maximum, minimum, average air temperature in degrees Centigrade, sum of precipitation in mm and snow depth in cm. We report the covariance between the average temperature and the precipitation as well. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Precipitation intensity is an important meteorological input for water erosion and runoff applications. A commonly used intensity factor is maximum 30-min intensity (I-30), which represents the sustained intensity of a storm. Determining I-30 is challenging for two reasons. First, intensity can vary significantly over time, even within very short durations of 5 min or less. Second, the majority of precipitation data sets are limited by their fixed-interval nature, and I-30 may not be constant within fixed measurement intervals. When intensity is simply averaged given the accumulation of a measurement interval, the temporal resolution of the precipitation data set biases the result. Therefore, in this study, bias adjustments were determined for a range of selected temporal resolutions and Koppen-Geiger climate regions in the United States. In this case, the intensity factor was monthly mean maximum 30-minute intensity (MX.5P), which is a parameter used to generate stochastic meteorological inputs for models that include the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion model (RHEM) and the Water Erosion Prediction Project model (WEPP). The adjustment factors were obtained by using linear regression of reference MX.5P values derived from breakpoint data against MX.5P values aggregated from the breakpoint data to represent lower temporal resolutions. The resulting slope coefficients were used to determine bias adjustment factors. In addition, multivariate machine learning regression was used to obtain more complex correlations involving a host of predictor variables that may each be determined from daily precipitation statistics and the spatial location of each station. In total, 609 stations and 16 climate classifications were represented in the regressions. Linear regressions for climate classifications gave RMSE for values of MX.5P derived from hourly data ranging from 0.98 to 3.46 mm hr(-1) with an average of 2.18 mm hr(-1). For daily data, the error range was 2.83-8.44 mm hr(-1) with an average of 5.61 mm hr(-1). The multivariate regression using machine learning algorithms improved regressions for coarser resolutions, reducing error to the 3-4 mm hr(-1) range for downscaled daily values.},

   abstract = {The Pannonian Basin in southeastern Europe is heavily used for rain-fed agriculture. The region experienced several droughts in the last years, causing major yield losses. Ongoing climate change, characterised by increasing temperatures and potential evapotranspiration, and by changes in precipitation distribution will likely increase the frequency and intensity of drought episodes in the future. Hence, ongoing monitoring of droughts and estimation of their impact on agriculture is necessary to adapt agricultural practices to changing weather and climate extremes. Several regional initiatives, projects and online tools have been established to facilitate drought monitoring and management in the Pannonian Basin. However, reliable systems to forecast potential drought impacts on plant productivity and agricultural yields at monthly to seasonal scales are only in their infancy, as plant response to climatic extremes is still poorly understood. With the increasing availability of high-resolution and long-term Earth Observation (EO) data and recent progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence, further improvements in drought monitoring and impact prediction capacities are expected. Here we review the current state of drought monitoring in the Pannonian Basin, identify EO-based variables to potentially improve regional drought impact monitoring and outline future perspectives for seasonal forecasts of drought impacts on agriculture.},

   abstract = {Spatial downscaling is an effective way to obtain precipitation with sufficient spatial details. The performance of downscaling is typically determined by the empirical statistical relationships between precipitation and the used auxiliary variables. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of five empirical statistical methods for spatial downscaling of GPM IMERG V06B monthly and annual precipitation with a relatively long time series from 2001 to 2015 over a typical semi-arid to arid area (Gansu province, China). These methods included two parametric regression methods (univariate regression, or UR; multivariate regression, or MR) and three machine learning methods (artificial neural network, or ANN; support vector machine, or SVM; random forests, or RF), which were used to downscale the satellite precipitation from 0.1 degrees (similar to 10 km) to 1 km spatial resolution. Five commonly used indices which were normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, land surface temperature (LST), and latitude and longitude were selected as auxiliary variables. The downscaled results were validated using a total of 80 rain gauge station data during 2001-2015. Results showed that latitude had the overall largest correlation with IMERG annual precipitation, also evidenced by feature importance measurements in RF. The downscaled results at monthly scale were overall consistent with the results at annual scale. The machine learning-based methods had better predictive ability of the original IMERG precipitation than parametric regression methods, with larger coefficient of determination (R (2)) and smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) as well as relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE). The downscaled 1 km IMERG precipitation by parametric regression methods had obvious underestimations (positive residual errors) in the south and east of Gansu province and overestimations (negative residual errors) in the west. In addition, the validation results of parametric regression downscaling methods showed large improvements after residual correction, while the improvements were small in the machine learning-based methods. However, the interpolation algorithm included in residual correction can cause certain errors in the downscaled results due to the ignorance of precipitation spatial heterogeneity. The machine learning-based RF downscaling had the smallest residual errors and the overall best validation results, showing great potentials to provide accurate precipitation with high spatial resolution.},

   abstract = {Precipitation deficit can affect different natural resources such as water, soil, rivers and plants, and cause meteorological, hydrological and agricultural droughts. Multivariate drought indexes can theoretically show the severity and weakness of various drought types simultaneously. This study introduces an approach for forecasting joint deficit index (JDI) and multivariate standardized precipitation index (MSPI) by using machine-learning methods and entropy theory. JDI and MSPI were calculated for the 1-12 months' time window (JDI(1-12) and MSPI1-12), using monthly precipitation data. The methods implemented for forecasting are group method of data handling (GMDH), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least squared support vector machine (LSSVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and ANFIS optimized with three heuristic optimization algorithms, differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as meta-innovative methods (ANFIS-DE, ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO). Monthly precipitation, monthly temperature and previous amounts of the index's values were used as inputs to the models. Data from 10 synoptic stations situated in the widest climatic zone of Iran (extra arid-cold climate) were employed. Optimal model inputs were selected by gamma test and entropy theory. The evaluation results, which were given using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and Willmott index (WI), show that the machine learning and meta-innovative models can present acceptable forecasts of general drought's conditions. The algorithms DE, GA and PSO, could improve the ANFIS's performance by 39.4%, 38.7% and 22.6%, respectively. Among all the applied models, the GMDH shows the best forecasting accuracy with MAE = 0.280, RMSE = 0.374 and WI = 0.955. In addition, the models could forecast MSPI better than JDI in the majority of cases (stations). Among the two methods used to select the optimal inputs, it is difficult to select one as a better input selector, but according to the results, more attention can be paid to entropy theory in drought studies.},

   abstract = {Accurate precipitation data at high spatiotemporal resolution are critical for land and water management at the basin scale. We proposed a downscaling framework for Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation products through integrating Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Colaboratory (Colab). Three machine learning methods, including Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were compared in the framework. Three vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI; Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI; Leaf Area Index, LAI), topography, and geolocation are selected as geospatial predictors to perform the downscaling. This framework can automatically optimize the models' parameters, estimate features' importance, and downscale the TRMM product to 1 km. The spatial downscaling of TRMM from 25 km to 1 km was achieved by using the relationships between annual precipitations and annually-averaged vegetation index. The monthly precipitation maps derived from the annual downscaled precipitation by disaggregation. According to validation in the Great Mekong upstream region, the ANN yielded the best performance when simulating the annual TRMM precipitation. The most sensitive vegetation index for downscaling TRMM was LAI, followed by EVI. Compared with existing downscaling methods, the proposed framework for downscaling TRMM can be performed online for any given region using a wide range of machine learning tools and environmental variables to generate a precipitation product with high spatiotemporal resolution.},

Biomass and primary productivity are the crucial dynamic biophysical parameters for understanding the ecosystem functioning in any forested landscape. The present study was performed in Aglar watershed situated in outer Indian Himalayan range. We performed geospatial modeling of plot-level field data on forest above ground biomass (AGB) by correlating it with textural, spectral and linearly transformed variables retrieved from Landsat 8 OLI data using of random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. We also applied recursive feature elimination function (RFE) to obtain the variables contributing most in AGB prediction. A combination of 24 among 96 variables was identified as the most effective variables. Ground-based AGB varied from 62.54 to 470.98 Mg ha(-1), whereas RF-modeled AGB ranged from 48.5 to 407.73 Mg ha(-1). Results indicated that RFE selected variables were able to predict AGB withR(2)of 0.84, RMSE of 42.03 Mg ha(-1), MAE of 34.68 and %RMSE of 19.49 Mg ha(-1)which was accepted considering the terrain complexity. Light use efficiency approach was used to model monthly NPP using Landsat 8 OLI data. The results indicated thatQuercusmixed forest had highest carbon assimilation (95,148,073.9 gC) followed byPinus roxburghii(1,863,187.7 gC),Cedrus deodara(5,752,954.1 gC) and mixed forest (2,634,737.1 gC). The seasonal pattern of NPP indicated that its strike peaked in October, whereas December and January were the lean months, suggesting that NPP is governed by climatic factors, viz. PAR, precipitation and temperature. Such watershed-level study in complex Himalayan terrain would help to understand complex biogeochemical processes in basins and ecosystem services provided by the forests.},

A machine learning algorithm is deployed to identify the best explanatory parameters because the problem is strongly prone to overfitting for traditional methods: if the number of parameters is the same or greater than the number of observations, then a linear model can perfectly fit the dependent variable (observations). Surprisingly, the best proxy of flowering date fluctuations is the daily snow depth anomaly, which cannot be a signal itself, however it should be related to some integrated temperature signal. Moreover, daily snow depth anomaly as proxy performs much better than mean soil temperature preceding the flowering, the best monthly explanatory parameter. Our findings support the existence of complicated temperature sensing mechanisms operating on different timescales, which is a prerequisite to precisely observe the length and severity of the winter season and translate for example, `lack of snow' information to meaningful internal signals related to phenophases.},

In this study, a novel hybrid method is proposed for monthly runoff prediction in Mangla watershed in northern Pakistan by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) with extreme learning machine (ELM) as ELM-PSOGWO. The proposed method was compared with the standalone ELM, hybrid of ELM-PSO, and binary hybrid PSOGSA (hybrid of PSO with gravitational search algorithm) methods. Monthly precipitation and runoff data were used as inputs to the models to examine their accuracy in terms of different statistical indexes. Test results showed that the proposed ELM-PSOGWO provided more accurate results than the standalone ELM, hybrid ELM-PSO, ELM-GWO nd binary hybrid PSOGSA methods in monthly runoff prediction. ELM-PSOGWO reduced the RMSE in prediction of ELM, ELM-PSO, ELM-GWO and ELM-PSOGSA by 38.2, 22.8, 22.4 and 16.7%, respectively. The PSO and GWO based ELM models also performed better than standalone ELM models, with an improvement in RMSE by 19.9 to 20.3%, respectively. Results also showed that adding precipitation as input enhanced the prediction accuracy of models. ELM-PSOGWO was also able to provide more precise estimates of peak runoff with the lowest absolute mean relative error compared to other methods. The results indicate the potential of ELM-PSOGWO model to be recommended for monthly runoff prediction.},

   abstract = {Long-term forecasting of any hydrologic phenomena is essential for strategic environmental planning, hydrologic and other forms of structural design, agriculture, and water resources management. Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gaugingstations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE ≈1.30% and RMAE ≈ 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.},

The method uses Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) following the ward’s method based on the monthly mean solar insolation on a horizontal surface (H), and Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM-C) to assist AHC to effectively classify all the areas based on solar radiation data plus temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation. Four solar radiation zones have been established. The zones are homogeneous in space and have distinctive solar and meteorological characteristics. The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is applied to the obtained zones to distinguish trends within solar radiation zones based on temperature, humidity and wind speed, and a total of 8 sub-zones with distinctive meteorological characteristics have been identified. The resulting solar radiation zones and sub-zones cover all Morocco can help for preliminary assessment and decision making, especially for areas with no solar radiation records.},

The fishery is also a part of marine life and affected by climate change-driven weather conditions directly or indirectly. In the present study, relationships between commercial species (grey mullet -≈90% of total capture- and gilthead seabream) that were captured from lagoon traps in Köyceğiz lagoon (Turkey) and local weather conditions were analysed. The machine learning method Random Forests (RF) was used to pre-select the model predictors. RF results showed that while temperature-related parameters, cloudy days, and wind speed were the most effective parameters, precipitation-parameters were the least important parameters for these two species catch. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to each fish species with the best pre-selected parameters, with the resulting equation being used for future prediction of the two fish species. Future prediction of predictors was calculated by monthly autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and 20th/80th percentile intervals were used as the scenarios. Simulations showed that an increase in some weather parameters (wind speed, seawater temperature, maximum air temperature, cloudy days) lead to an increase in grey mullet and (wind speed) gilthead seabream catch. Models proved that the impact of the weather parameters differs for those two targeted fish species although they live in the same environment. We recommend that individual fish species (and/or catch) should be used in the models, not the whole fish yield. Moreover, the model can also be used for non-commercial species in ecosystem-based studies. Changes in weather parameters due to climate change should be monitored to make proper decision on fishery management.},

   abstract = {The application of land use regression (LUR) modeling for estimating air pollution exposure has been used only rarely in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This is generally due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks in the region. Low cost air quality sensors developed locally in sub-Saharan Africa presents a sustainable operating mechanism that may help generate the air monitoring data needed for exposure estimation of air pollution with LUR models. The primary objective of our study is to investigate whether a network of locally developed low-cost air quality sensors can be used in LUR modeling for accurately predicting monthly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas of central and eastern Uganda. Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether the application of machine learning (ML) can improve LUR predictions compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We used data for the entire year of 2020 from a network of 23 PM2.5 low-cost sensors located in urban municipalities of eastern and central Uganda. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, these sensors collected highly time-resolved measurement data of PM2.5 air concentrations. We used monthly-averaged PM2.5 concentration data for LUR prediction modeling of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. We used eight different ML base-learner algorithms as well as ensemble modeling. We applied 5-fold cross validation (80% training/20% test random splits) to evaluate the models with resampling and Root mean squared error (RMSE). The relative explanatory power and accuracy of the ML algorithms were evaluated by comparing coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE, using OLS as the reference approach. The overall average PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 52.22 μg/m3 (IQR: 38.11, 62.84 μg/m3)—well above World Health Organization PM2.5 ambient air guidelines. From the base-learner and ensemble models, RMSE and R2 values ranged between 7.65 μg/m3 – 16.85 μg/m3 and 0.24–0.84, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) performed best out of the base learner algorithms (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 7.65 μg/m3). Model performance from ensemble modeling with Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (glmnet) did not outperform xgbTree, but prediction performance was comparable to that of xgbTree. The most important temporal and spatial predictors of monthly PM2.5 levels were monthly precipitation, percent of the population using solid fuels for cooking, distance to Lake Victoria, and greenspace (NDVI) within a 500-m buffer of air monitors. In conclusion, data from locally developed low-cost PM sensors provide evidence that they can be used for spatio-temporal prediction modeling of air pollution exposures in Uganda. Moreover, the non-parametric ML and ensemble approaches to LUR modeling clearly outperformed OLS regression algorithm for the prediction of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. Deploying low-cost air quality sensors in concert with implementation of data quality control measures, can help address the critical need for expanding and improving air quality monitoring in resource-constrained settings of sub-Saharan Africa. These low-cost sensors, in conjunction with non-parametric ML algorithms, may provide a rapid path forward for PM2.5 exposure assessment and to spur air pollution epidemiology research in the region.},

This study aims to evaluate five downscaling methods to determine the accuracy and efficiency of which on generating high-resolution precipitation data at annual and monthly scales. To establish precipitation-Land surface characteristics relationship, environmental factors, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM), were considered as proxies in the spatial downscaling procedure. The downscaling algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), geographically weighted regression (GWR), multiple linear regression (MLR) and exponential regression (ER), were implemented to downscale the version 7 of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation (3B43 V7 product) over Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) from 0.25° to 1 km spatial resolution. The downscaled precipitation data was validated against observations from meteorological stations. Monthly fractions derived from TRMM 3B43 were used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation. Furthermore, the best method was selected for calibration based on Geographical Difference Analysis (GDA) to assess the effectiveness of the calibration as a viable option. The results indicate that SVM not only outperforms the other methods, but also has good agreements with in-situ measurements compared to the original TRMM. The results confirm that inclusion of LST and geographic information along with NDVI can improve the downscaling performance. Downscaling and GDA calibration significantly improve the accuracy of TRMM 3B43 product at both spatial and temporal resolution and should be considered as an essential step in calibration of TRMM precipitation. Calibration at monthly scale yields slightly better results than calibration at annual scale and then disaggregating into monthly maps in terms of accuracy assessment.},

   abstract = {Previous studies linking large-scale atmospheric circulation and river flow with traditional machine learning techniques have predominantly explored monthly, seasonal or annual streamflow modelling for applications in direct downscaling or hydrological climate-impact studies. This paper identifies major drivers of daily streamflow from large-scale atmospheric circulation using two reanalysis datasets for six catchments in Norway representing various Köppen-Geiger climate types and flood-generating processes. A nested loop of roughly pruned random forests is used for feature extraction, demonstrating the potential for automated retrieval of physically consistent and interpretable input variables. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) for regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are compared to multiple-linear regression to assess the role of model complexity in utilizing the identified major drivers to reconstruct streamflow. The machine learning models were trained on 31 years of aggregated atmospheric data with distinct moving windows for each catchment, reflecting catchment-specific forcing-response relationships between the atmosphere and the rivers. The results show that accuracy improves to some extent with model complexity. In all but the smallest, rainfall-driven catchment, the most complex model, MLP, gives a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) ranging from 0.71 to 0.81 on testing data spanning five years. The poorer performance by all models in the smallest catchment is discussed in relation to catchment characteristics, sub-grid topography and local variability. The intra-model differences are also viewed in relation to the consistency between the automatically retrieved feature selections from the two reanalysis datasets. This study provides a benchmark for future development of deep learning models for direct downscaling from large-scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow in Norway.},

   abstract = {Climate change assessment at a local scale requires downscaling of general circulation models (GCMs) using various approaches. In this study, statistical downscaling using established machine learning techniques is compared with the proposed extreme gradient boosting decision tree (EXGBDT) technique. The Cauvery river basin in southern peninsular India, which is known for its frequent droughts and floods, was considered in this study. The ACCESS 1.0 CMIP5 historical GCM simulation was used for downscaling the local climate with the help of daily observation data from 35 stations located in the study zone. An intercomparison of model performance in predicting daily weather variables such as precipitation and average, maximum, and minimum temperatures over the upper, middle, and lower Cauvery river basin was performed. The findings show that mean-variance is around 15 % and bias is negligible for the proposed EXGBDT model, which is better than other models under consideration. The NSE and R-2 values range from 0.75-0.85 for both training and testing periods. The intercomparison of monthly mean values of observed and downscaled data for different sub-basins and parameters suggests higher model efficiency. The lower variance observed in the comparison of CLIMDEX indices suggests that the EXGBDT model performance is better in representing the local climatic condition.},

   abstract = {The increasing release of nutrients to aquatic environments has led to great concern regarding eutrophication and the risk of unwanted algal blooms. Based on observational data of 20 water quality parameters measured on a monthly basis at 40 stations from 2011 to 2020, this study applied different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to suggest the best option for algal bloom prediction in the Han River, a large river in South Korea. Eight different ML algorithms were categorized into several groups of statistical learning, regression family, and deep learning, and were then compared for their suitability to predict the chlorophyll-derived trophic index (TSI-Chla). ML algorithms helped identify the most important water quality parameters contributing to algal bloom prediction. The ML results confirmed that eutrophication and algal proliferation were governed by the complex interplay between nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), organic contaminants, and environmental factors. Of the models tested, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) exhibited the best performance owing to its consistent and outperforming prediction both quantitatively (i.e., via regression) and qualitatively (i.e., via classification), which was evidenced by the lowest value of mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.09, and the highest F1-score, Recall and Precision of 0.97, 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. In a further step, a representative web application was constructed to assist common users to predict the trophic status of the Han River. This study demonstrated that ML techniques are not only promising for highly accurate water quality modeling of urban rivers, but also reduce time and labor intensity for experiments, which decreases the number of monitored water quality parameters, providing further insights into the driving factors of water quality deterioration. They ultimately help devise proactive strategies for sustainable water management.},

   abstract = {Accurate and efficient runoff simulations are crucial for water management in basins. Rainfall-runoff simulation approaches range between physical, conceptual, and data-driven models. With the recent development of machine-learning techniques, machine learning methods have been widely applied in the field of hydrology. Existing studies show that such methods can achieve comparable or even better performances than conventional hydrological models in runoff simulation. In particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are able to overcome the shortcomings of traditional neural network methods in handling time series data. However, the impacts of the time memory on rainfall-runoff simulation are rarely studied. In this study, hysteresis effects in hydrology were investigated and the performances of machine learning methods and traditional hydrological models were assessed. The results show that the ANN model is more suitable for monthly scale simulation, while the LSTM model performs better at daily scale. Hydrological hysteresis is important for runoff simulations when using machine learning methods, especially at daily scale. By considering hysteresis in the simulation, the RMSE is significantly improved by 27% (21%) for LSTM (ANN). In addition, LSTM is more robust for time series handling, while the ANN is easier to be overfitted due to the limitation of neural network structure. This study provides new insights into the potential use of machine learning in hydrological simulations.},

In those coupled model exercises, after the parameter calibrations of the CRR models are made, their specific outputs constitute auxiliary inputs for the ML model training. However, in this parallel hybridization comprising two consecutive processes, performing the cascade calibration of CRR and ML models increases the computational complexity. Moreover, the mutual interaction between the parameters governing CRR and ML models is also not considered. In this study, to cope with the handicaps mentioned, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were separately embedded into a monthly lumped CRR model. The dynamic water balance model (dynwbm) was preferred as the CRR model. Then, all free parameters within these nested hybrid models were calibrated simultaneously. The ML parts within the nested schemes manipulate various output variants derived with three conceptual parameters for monthly runoff simulation. These new hybrid models equipped with an automatic calibration algorithm were applied at several locations in the Gediz River Basin of western Turkey. The performance measures regarding mean and high flows indicated that the nested hybrid models outperformed the standalone models (i.e., dynwbm, ANN, and SVR) and coupled model variants. Thus, the credibility of a novel modeling strategy, which takes advantage of the supplementary strengths of a conceptual model and different ML techniques, was demonstrated.},

   abstract = {The scarcity of site-scale actual evapotranspiration (ET) measurements poses a challenge for modelling and verifying regional ET. Taking the grassland ecosystem in arid and semi-arid regions of Northern China (ASNC) as an example, we proposed a framework for estimating ET at weather stations without flux observations through a machine learning approach by combining data from MODIS and fifteen flux towers distributed in alpine grassland (AG) and temperate grassland (TG) across ASNC. First, we analyzed the temporal characteristics of grassland ET at site scale. Second, we applied the machine learning approach Random Forest (RF) to develop a robust model for simulating site-scale grassland ET, and used random and spatial cross-validations (CVs) and three metrics to evaluate the RF models performance. Two strategies (using pooled data from all flux towers for a general model, and dividing data by grassland type to develop models specific to AG and TG) and four temporal resolutions (daily, 8-day, monthly and seasonal) were used to develop the RF models. Third, we investigated how the importance of predictor variables for estimating grassland ET changed in different CVs, strategies and temporal resolutions. The ET of AG and TG showed similar dynamic patterns but differed in magnitude. The RF models showed good performance in both strategies and all four temporal resolutions (R2 > 0.64, MAE < 0.53 mm d−1, RMSE < 0.72 mm d−1). However, seasonal ET simulations performed better than that of daily, 8-day and monthly using pooled data from all flux towers, especially in spatial CV. Meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and radiation), vegetation (NDVI, LAI and FPAR) and soil (soil water content and soil temperature) were strong predictors of variation in grassland ET. Changes in the importance ranking and value of predictor variables partly explained the variations of model performance. The robust model performance in spatial CV proved that the framework developed in this study was reliable when applied to weather stations without flux observations, thereby overcoming the scarcity of site-scale actual ET measurements.},

Many studies have focused on the mechanisms behind the generation and development of this event; however, little research into its characteristics exists due to a lack of a widely accepted method for accurate detection and quantification. Using a function collection containing various methods, different methods can be compared in terms of their performance in the detection and quantification of bimodal precipitation signals, allowing the proposal of appropriate criteria for method choice in various study types. Five methods (Mosino and Garcia, 1966; Curtis, 2002; Angeles et al., 2010; Karnauskas et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2020) are adapted to the Climate Prediction Centre data during 1979-2017 in the domain of southern Mexico and Central America, and their performances are evaluated and compared. While outputs from the five methods reach general consistence for strong bimodal features over the Pacific side of Central America and Yucatan Peninsula, some biases are identified, specifically shown by the fact that methods using monthly climatological data demonstrates bimodal precipitation over the Caribbean side of Central America, while those using daily annual data indicate the existence of bimodal precipitation over the Pacific side of southern Mexico. By comparing two typical algorithms, we determined that this bias was induced by the limitation of temporal resolution in monthly climatological data and the nature of algorithms applying daily annual data. As part of a case study, a cluster algorithm was applied to outputs from an algorithm using daily annual precipitation, and a classification algorithm was used to test clustering performance. The resultant general high accuracy shows that annual bimodal signals offer good adaption to cluster and other potential machine learning algorithms.},

Although many studies have calculated the R-factor using various empirical methods or the USLE method, these methods are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge for the user. The purpose of this study is to develop machine learning models to predict the R-factor faster and more accurately than the previous methods. For this, this study calculated R-factor using 1-min interval rainfall data for improved accuracy of the target value. First, the monthly R-factors were calculated using the USLE calculation method to identify the characteristics of monthly rainfall-runoff induced erosion. In turn, machine learning models were developed to predict the R-factor using the monthly R-factors calculated at 50 sites in Korea as target values. The machine learning algorithms used for this study were Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boost, and Deep Neural Network. As a result of the validation with 20% randomly selected data, the Deep Neural Network (DNN), among seven models, showed the greatest prediction accuracy results. The DNN developed in this study was tested for six sites in Korea to demonstrate trained model performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.87. This means that our findings show that DNN can be efficiently used to estimate monthly R-factor at the desired site with much less effort and time with total monthly precipitation, maximum daily precipitation, and maximum hourly precipitation data. It will be used not only to calculate soil erosion risk but also to establish soil conservation plans and identify areas at risk of soil disasters by calculating rainfall erosivity factors.},

   abstract = {The potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is accumulating in the atmosphere at unprecedented rates largely due to agricultural intensification, and cultivated soils contribute similar to 60% of the agricultural flux. Empirical models of N2O fluxes for intensively managed cropping systems are confounded by highly variable fluxes and limited geographic coverage; process-based biogeochemical models are rarely able to predict daily to monthly emissions with >20% accuracy even with site-specific calibration. Here we show the promise for machine learning (ML) to significantly improve field-level flux predictions, especially when coupled with a cropping systems model to simulate unmeasured soil parameters. We used sub-daily N2O flux data from six years of automated flux chambers installed in a continuous corn rotation at a site in the upper US Midwest (similar to 3000 sub-daily flux observations), supplemented with weekly to biweekly manual chamber measurements (similar to 1100 daily fluxes), to train an ML model that explained 65%-89% of daily flux variance with very few input variables-soil moisture, days after fertilization, soil texture, air temperature, soil carbon, precipitation, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate. When applied to a long-term test site not used to train the model, the model explained 38% of the variation observed in weekly to biweekly manual chamber measurements from corn, and 51% upon coupling the ML model with a cropping systems model that predicted daily soil N availability. This represents a two to three times improvement over conventional process-based models and with substantially fewer input requirements. This coupled approach offers promise for better predictions of agricultural N2O emissions and thus more precise global models and more effective agricultural mitigation interventions.},

Droughts are usually monitored using drought indices (DIs), most of which are probabilistic and therefore, highly stochastic and non-linear. The current research investigated the capability of different versions of relatively well-explored machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF), minimum probability machine regression (MPMR), M5 Tree (M5tree), extreme learning machine (ELM) and online sequential-ELM (OSELM) in predicting the most widely used DI known as standardized precipitation index (SPI) at multiple month horizons (i.e., 1, 3, 6 and 12). Models were developed using monthly rainfall data for the period of 1949-2013 at four meteorological stations namely, Barisal, Bogra, Faridpur and Mymensingh, each representing a geographical region of Bangladesh which frequently experiences droughts. The model inputs were decided based on correlation statistics and the prediction capability was evaluated using several statistical metrics including mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), Willmott's Index of agreement (WI), Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and Legates and McCabe Index (LM). The results revealed that the proposed models are reliable and robust in predicting droughts in the region. Comparison of the models revealed ELM as the best model in forecasting droughts with minimal RMSE in the range of 0.07-0.85, 0.08-0.76, 0.062-0.80 and 0.042-0.605 for Barisal, Bogra, Faridpur and Mymensingh, respectively for all the SPI scales except one-month SPI for which the RF showed the best performance with minimal RMSE of 0.57, 0.45, 0.59 and 0.42, respectively.},

Total 56 soil samples were collected from the surface soil layer (similar to 5 cm) in correspondence with the passing date of the Sentinel-1 sensor over the study area. The surface SMC was estimated for bare soil areas, which was extracted by applying the threshold values on vegetation and water index maps derived from the Sentinel-2 multispectral data. The univariate linear regression with the co-polarized VV band provided higher accuracy compared to the cross-polarized VH band. However, the multiple linear regression with VV and VH bands indicated similar accuracy as obtained by the VV band alone. The random forest model was observed as the best performing ML model for soil moisture estimation (R-2 = 0.87 and 0.93 during modeling and validation, respectively; RMSE: similar to 0.03). The obtained results indicate well accurate surface soil moisture verified with in-situ information collected during the dry rabi crop season (January to March 2019). The maximum SMC was observed for March, followed by February and January, that corroborated with the total monthly precipitation and irrigation activities. The study highlights the potentiality of ML models and Sentinel-1 SAR data for soil moisture estimation, which is useful for policy-level implications and decision making in agriculture and water resource management activities.},

Based on multicollinearity test using the Variance Inflation Factor, four climatic factors and six landuse types were used as independent variables for NDVI simulation. The calibrated and validated statistical vegetation models denoted good performance using four machine learning algorithms. The ensemble results from the four machine learning modelling were used to assess the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature and precipitation change on annual and monthly scale. Based on historical climatic variability and future scenarios, eight hypothetical climatic scenarios for the changes in temperature and precipitation were used in this study. The results indicated that there were positive responses of NDVI to temperature and precipitation change. As an one degrees C increase in temperature, the NDVI was going to increase by 3.03%-5.79%, and it would increase by 3.35%-4.80% when the precipitation increased 10% in the YHHRB. Relatively, the NDVI was more sensitive to precipitation decrease than increase. The sensitivity of NDVI to temperature or precipitation was non-linear as temperature or precipitation changing for a specified climatic zone. Monthly, the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature change varied among the four climatic zones, but as precipitation increasing, the higher and lower sensitivity of NDVI were investigated in wetter and drier months, respectively. Spatially, the NDVI was more sensitive to temperature and precipitation in colder and drier areas, respectively. Landuse also has a significant impact on the sensitivity of NDVI to climate change. The results might be useful for understanding the climate-vegetation dynamics and landuse management under future climate change.},

This paper identifies major drivers of daily streamflow from large-scale atmospheric circulation using two reanalysis datasets for six catchments in Norway representing various Koppen-Geiger climate types and flood-generating processes. A nested loop of roughly pruned random forests is used for feature extraction, demonstrating the potential for automated retrieval of physically consistent and interpretable input variables. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) for regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are compared to multiple-linear regression to assess the role of model complexity in utilizing the identified major drivers to reconstruct streamflow. The machine learning models were trained on 31 years of aggregated atmospheric data with distinct moving windows for each catchment, reflecting catchment-specific forcing-response relationships between the atmosphere and the rivers. The results show that accuracy improves to some extent with model complexity. In all but the smallest, rainfall-driven catchment, the most complex model, MLP, gives a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) ranging from 0.71 to 0.81 on testing data spanning five years. The poorer performance by all models in the smallest catchment is discussed in relation to catchment characteristics, sub-grid topography and local variability. The intra-model differences are also viewed in relation to the consistency between the automatically retrieved feature selections from the two reanalysis datasets. This study provides a benchmark for future development of deep learning models for direct downscaling from large-scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow in Norway.},

   abstract = {Rainfall impacts local water quantity and quality. Accurate and timely prediction of rainfall is highly desirable in water management and hydrogeologic hazards mitigation, which is critical for the environmentally sustainable development. Previous rainfall prediction processes are complex and computationally costly for its intrinsic high uncertainty and variability. In this paper, a data-driven approach is applied to predict the rainfall based on historic data via time-series modeling and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM). The rainfall datasets collected from six counties within Three Georges Reservoir are utilized as case studies in this research, first, the rainfall data is pre-processed with outlier removal and missing value imputation, and the monthly ahead difference is computed based on the instant average of monthly rainfall. Next, the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function were computed and the Ljung-Box test statistic is utilized to explore the significance of the historic lagged-series. All the statistically significant historic lags are selected as inputs for prediction algorithms. Last, an OP-ELM algorithm is developed to predict the monthly rainfall with tenfold cross validation. Four activation functions: the sigmoid, sine, hardlim, and radial basis function, are considered in the OP-ELM. The prediction performance is evaluated with metrics including mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and max error rate. Overall, the computational results indicate the proposed framework outperforms the other benchmarking machine learning algorithms through six case studies in Three Gorges Reservoir, China.},

   abstract = {In science, estimation is the calculation of a current value, while forecasting (or prediction) is the calculation of a future value. Both estimation and forecasting are based on covariates. However, whereas estimation enables greater agility in current decision making, forecasting can reveal different strategies for the future. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has brought improvements in accuracy to the estimation and forecasting of agricultural yield for various crops around the world. These models are part of a set of machine-learning models, becoming an important ally not only to producers, companies, cooperatives, and to government institutions for decisions making and strategic decisions at all levels of the agricultural system. The main constraints of agricultural production are climatic conditions and soil water availability during crop cycles. We propose the use of ANNs for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield estimation and forecasting 2 mo before harvesting in the region of MATOPIBA, the largest and the last agricultural frontier of Brazil. This tropical agricultural area has about 73,173,485 hectares, corresponding to approximately 1.3 times the area of France. The input features for ANN were the monthly climatic conditions of air temperature, precipitation, and global radiation, as well as components of the water balance such as crop evapotranspiration, soil water storage, actual evapotranspiration, water deficiency, and surpluses during the cultivation cycle. The evaluation of ANN for yield estimation had R-2 = .88 and RMSE = 167.85 kg ha(-1), while the ANN for forecasting obtained R-2 = .86 and RMSE = 185.85 kg ha(-1).},

In this study, we applied two advanced Machine Learning Models (MLM) and latest General Circulation Models (GCM) to generate deterministic MPFs with a resolution of 0.5 degrees across China. Then the Bayesian Joint Probability (BJP) modeling approach is employed to calibrate and generate corresponding ensemble MPFs. Raw and post-processing MPFs were put against gridded observations over the period of 1981-2015. The results indicated that: (1) for deterministic evaluation, the forecasting performance of MLMs was more inclined to generate random forecasts around the mean value, while the GCMs could reflect the increasing or decreasing trend of precipitation to some degree; (2) for probabilistic evaluation, the four BJP calibrated ensemble MPFs were unbiased and reliable. Compared to climatology, reliability and sharpness were all significantly improved. However, in terms of overall accuracy metric, the ensemble MPFs generated from MLMs were similar to climatology. In contrast, the ensemble MPFs generated from GCMs achieved better forecasting skill and were not dependent on forecasting regions and months. Moreover, the post-processing method is necessary to achieve not only bias-free but also reliable as well as skillful ensemble MPFs.},

In those coupled model exercises, after the parameter calibrations of the CRR models are made, their specific outputs constitute auxiliary inputs for the ML model training. However, in this parallel hybridization comprising two consecutive processes, performing the cascade calibration of CRR and ML models increases the computational complexity. Moreover, the mutual interaction between the parameters governing CRR and ML models is also not considered. In this study, to cope with the handicaps mentioned, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were separately embedded into a monthly lumped CRR model. The dynamic water balance model (dynwbm) was preferred as the CRR model. Then, all free parameters within these nested hybrid models were calibrated simultaneously. The ML parts within the nested schemes manipulate various output variants derived with three conceptual parameters for monthly runoff simulation. These new hybrid models equipped with an automatic calibration algorithm were applied at several locations in the Gediz River Basin of western Turkey. The performance measures regarding mean and high flows indicated that the nested hybrid models outperformed the standalone models (i.e., dynwbm, ANN, and SVR) and coupled model variants. Thus, the credibility of a novel modeling strategy, which takes advantage of the supplementary strengths of a conceptual model and different ML techniques, was demonstrated.},

However, there exist data gaps, especially for the area of China, due to the limitations in remote sensing of SM such as complex topography, human-induced radio frequency interference (RFI), and vegetation disturbances, etc. The data gaps make the CCI SM data cannot achieve spatial continuity, which entails the study of gap-filling methods. In order to develop suitable methods to fill the gaps of CCI SM in the whole area of China, we compared typical Machine Learning (ML) methods, including Random Forest method (RF), Feedforward Neural Network method (FNN), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a geostatistical method, i.e., Ordinary Kriging (OK) in this study. More than 30 years of passive-active combined CCI SM from 1982 to 2018 and other biophysical variables such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, air temperature, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), soil type, and in situ SM from International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) were utilized in this study. Results indicated that: (1) the data gap of CCI SM is frequent in China, which is found not only in cold seasons and areas but also in warm seasons and areas. The ratio of gap pixel numbers to the whole pixel numbers can be greater than 80%, and its average is around 40%. (2) ML methods can fill the gaps of CCI SM all up. Among the ML methods, RF had the best performance in fitting the relationship between CCI SM and biophysical variables. (3) Over simulated gap areas, RF had a comparable performance with OK, and they outperformed the FNN and GLM methods greatly. (4) Over in situ SM networks, RF achieved better performance than the OK method. (5) We also explored various strategies for gap-filling CCI SM. Results demonstrated that the strategy of constructing a monthly model with one RF for simulating monthly average SM and another RF for simulating monthly SM disturbance achieved the best performance. Such strategy combining with the ML method such as the RF is suggested in this study for filling the gaps of CCI SM in China.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the development of models for the prediction of power generation at the Samanalawewa hydropower plant, which is one of the major power stations in Sri Lanka. Four regression-based machine learning and statistical techniques were applied to develop the prediction models. Rainfall data at six locations in the catchment area of the Samanalawewa reservoir from 1993 to 2019 were used as the main input variables. The minimum and maximum temperature and evaporation at the reservoir site were also incorporated. The collinearities between the variables were investigated in terms of Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients. It was found that rainfall at one location is less impactful on power generation, while that at other locations are highly correlated with each other. Prediction models based on monthly and quarterly data were developed, and their performance was evaluated in terms of the correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), ratio of the root mean square error (RMSE) to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), BIAS, and the Nash number. Of the Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector regression (SVR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and power regression (PR), the machine learning techniques (GPR and SVR) produced the comparably accurate prediction models. Being the most accurate prediction model, the GPR produced the best correlation coefficient closer to 1 with a very less error. This model could be used in predicting the hydropower generation at the Samanalawewa power station using the rainfall forecast.},

   abstract = {The application of land use regression (LUR) modeling for estimating air pollution exposure has been used only rarely in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This is generally due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks in the region. Low cost air quality sensors developed locally in sub-Saharan Africa presents a sustainable operating mechanism that may help generate the air monitoring data needed for exposure estimation of air pollution with LUR models. The primary objective of our study is to investigate whether a network of locally developed low-cost air quality sensors can be used in LUR modeling for accurately predicting monthly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas of central and eastern Uganda. Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether the application of machine learning (ML) can improve LUR predictions compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We used data for the entire year of 2020 from a network of 23 PM2.5 low-cost sensors located in urban municipalities of eastern and central Uganda. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, these sensors collected highly time-resolved measurement data of PM2.5 air concentrations. We used monthlyaveraged PM2.5 concentration data for LUR prediction modeling of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. We used eight different ML base-learner algorithms as well as ensemble modeling. We applied 5-fold cross validation (80% training/20% test random splits) to evaluate the models with resampling and Root mean squared error (RMSE). The relative explanatory power and accuracy of the ML algorithms were evaluated by comparing coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE, using OLS as the reference approach. The overall average PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 52.22 mu g/m3 (IQR: 38.11, 62.84 mu g/m3)-well above World Health Organization PM2.5 ambient air guidelines. From the base-learner and ensemble models, RMSE and R2 values ranged between 7.65 mu g/m3 - 16.85 mu g/m3 and 0.24-0.84, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) performed best out of the base learner algorithms (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 7.65 mu g/m3). Model performance from ensemble modeling with Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (glmnet) did not outperform xgbTree, but prediction performance was comparable to that of xgbTree. The most important temporal and spatial predictors of monthly PM2.5 levels were monthly precipitation, percent of the population using solid fuels for cooking, distance to Lake Victoria, and greenspace (NDVI) within a 500-m buffer of air monitors. In conclusion, data from locally developed low-cost PM sensors provide evidence that they can be used for spatiotemporal prediction modeling of air pollution exposures in Uganda. Moreover, the non-parametric ML and ensemble approaches to LUR modeling clearly outperformed OLS regression algorithm for the prediction of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. Deploying low-cost air quality sensors in concert with implementation of data quality control measures, can help address the critical need for expanding and improving air quality monitoring in resource-constrained settings of sub-Saharan Africa. These low-cost sensors, in conjunction with nonparametric ML algorithms, may provide a rapid path forward for PM2.5 exposure assessment and to spur air pollution epidemiology research in the region.},

However, data collection is very difficult and costly in undeveloped countries. Therefore, obtaining a general model and using less input data is the key to popularizing the application of machine learning models for estimating groundwater levels. This study evaluated the potential of the kernel-based nonlinear extension of the Arps decline model (KNEA), long short-term memory network (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for accurately estimating GWL in the Hetao Irrigation District in China. All models were developed using monthly records from 143 monitoring wells between 1990 and 2015. Eight input combinations (including the one-month prior GWL, air temperature, global solar radiation, precipitation and amount of irrigation) were applied to explore the possibility of improving model accuracy using less input data. In addition, the general performance of the models was evaluated by cross validation. The results showed that the KNEA model was superior to the LSTM and GRU models for all input combinations using the local application. For cross-district application, the average statistical results indicated that the LSTM (RMSE = 0.45 m and R2 = 0.78) and GRU (RMSE = 0.48 m and R2 = 0.76) models performed better than the KNEA model (RMSE = 0.70 m and R2 = 0.62), and the LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and stability. For input data, these three models had difficulty obtaining satisfactory monthly GWLs using meteorological and irrigation data without pervious GWL data. Adding meteorological data on the basis of the historical GWL greatly improved the accuracy of the models. Compared with PREC and GSR, adding temperature input had the best improvement. However, adding large-scale average irrigation data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the models. In addition, the LSTM model and input data of the historical GWLs and temperature were recommended in arid and semiarid agricultural areas with limited data.},

To quantify this impact, we applied the Random Forest (RF) machine learning approach, taking advantage of a century of observations. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Since the late 1990s the monthly variation in lake water levels has doubled, as has variation in monthly abstraction. Increased variation in annual cumulated precipitation and a rise in mean air temperature have also been observed. The RF machine learning approach made it possible to confirm the marginal role of temperature, the increasing role of abstraction during the last two decades (from 24 % to 39 %), and the key role played by the increased precipitation variability. These results highlight the notable prediction and inference capabilities of RF in a complex and partially unknown hydrological context. We conclude by discussing the limits of this approach, which are mainly associated with its capacity to generates scenarios compared to physical based models.},

With the recent development of machine-learning techniques, machine learning methods have been widely applied in the field of hydrology. Existing studies show that such methods can achieve comparable or even better performances than conventional hydrological models in runoff simulation. In particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are able to overcome the shortcomings of traditional neural network methods in handling time series data. However, the impacts of the time memory on rainfall-runoff simulation are rarely studied. In this study, hysteresis effects in hydrology were investigated and the performances of machine learning methods and traditional hydrological models were assessed. The results show that the ANN model is more suitable for monthly scale simulation, while the LSTM model performs better at daily scale. Hydrological hysteresis is important for runoff simulations when using machine learning methods, especially at daily scale. By considering hysteresis in the simulation, the RMSE is significantly improved by 27% (21%) for LSTM (ANN). In addition, LSTM is more robust for time series handling, while the ANN is easier to be overfitted due to the limitation of neural network structure.

New hydrological insights for the region: CHIRPSv2 was the best-performing P product (median monthly KGE' of 0.80) and PMLv2 and WaPORv2.1 the best-performing ETa products over the majority of the evaluated catchments.

In the present study, relationships between commercial species (grey mullet -approximate to 90% of total capture-and gilthead seabream) that were captured from lagoon traps in Koycegiz lagoon (Turkey) and local weather conditions were analysed. The machine learning method Random Forests (RF) was used to pre-select the model predictors. RF results showed that while temperature-related parameters, cloudy days, and wind speed were the most effective parameters, precipitation-parameters were the least important parameters for these two species catch. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to each fish species with the best pre-selected parameters, with the resulting equation being used for future prediction of the two fish species. Future prediction of predictors was calculated by monthly autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and 20th/80th percentile intervals were used as the scenarios. Simulations showed that an increase in some weather parameters (wind speed, seawater temperature, maximum air temperature, cloudy days) lead to an increase in grey mullet and (wind speed) gilthead seabream catch. Models proved that the impact of the weather parameters differs for those two targeted fish species although they live in the same environment. We recommend that individual fish species (and/or catch) should be used in the models, not the whole fish yield. Moreover, the model can also be used for non-commercial species in ecosystem-based studies. Changes in weather parameters due to climate change should be monitored to make proper decision on fishery management. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease in China, Japan, and Korea. This study aimed to estimate the monthly SFTS occurrence and the monthly number of SFTS cases in the geographical area in Korea using epidemiological data including demographic, geographic, and meteorological factors. Important features were chosen through univariate feature selection. Two models using machine learning methods were analyzed: the classification model in machine learning (CMML) and regression model in machine learning (RMML). We developed a novel model incorporating the CMML results into RMML, defined as modified-RMML. Feature importance was computed to assess the contribution of estimating the number of SFTS cases using modified-RMML. Aspect to the accuracy of the novel model, the performance of modified-RMML was improved by reducing the MSE for the test data as 12.6-52.2%, compared to the RMML using five machine learning methods. During the period of increasing the SFTS cases from May to October, the modified-RMML could give more accurate estimation. Computing the feature importance, it is clearly observed that climate factors such as average maximum temperature, precipitation as well as mountain visitors, and the estimation of SFTS occurrence obtained from CMML had high Gini importance. The novel model incorporating CMML and RMML models improves the accuracy of the estimation of SFTS cases. Using the model, climate factors, including temperature, relative humidity, and mountain visitors play important roles in transmitting SFTS in Korea. Our findings highlighted that the guidelines for mountain visitors to prevent SFTS transmissions should be addressed. Moreover, it provides important insights for establishing control interventions that predict early identification of SFTS cases.},

   abstract = {Dust pollution is one of the major environmental crises in the arid regions of Iran and there is a need to predict dust pollution and identify its controlling factors to help reduce its adverse effects on the livelihood of residents of these areas. Although deep neural networks (DNN) are powerful tools in the modelling of environmental phenomena, they are recognized as being challenging to interpret due to their black-box nature. To address this issue and understand the importance of each environmental control on dust pollution, game theory (i.e., Shapley values) was used to better understand the performance and interpretability of DNN models. Here, monthly mean values of precipitation, air temperature, surface wind speed, potential evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference salinity index, Palmer drought severity index, soil heat flux, and surface pressure were selected as explanatory variables. The dust storm index (DSI), an indicator of dust pollution, was the predicted response variable for the cold and warm months. The results showed that the accuracies of the DNN model in predicting cold months DSI (CMDSI) and warm months DSI (WMDSI) were higher compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms. DNN model increased the R2 by 13% and 15% for predicting CMDSI and WMDSI, respectively, compared to the Random Forest model, which was the second most effective approach. According to the Shapley values, the most important controls on the occurrence of dust storms during the cold months of the study period (2000-2018) were wind speed, soil heat flux, and precipitation. During the warm months, wind speed was the most important controlling factor and was followed by precipitation, soil heat flux, and potential evapotranspiration. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DNN model and game theory in identifying the factors affecting dust pollution, which may help mitigate its impacts on the residents of western Iran.},

   abstract = {InSAR processing is vastly used for land deformation monitoring from the space. Machine learning methods are known as strong tools for data modeling as well as predicting. In this study, we are going to model and predict the future behavior of land subsidence by InSAR processing and leveraging deep learning methods over the lands in the vicinity of Lake Urmia (located in the northwest of Iran). Accordingly, Sentinel-1 data over 56 months from November 2014 to June 2019 and small baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR methods were utilized. Several regions with a high rate of subsidence were identified (maximum monthly subsidence of 13.3 mm). Furthermore, environmental factors affecting subsidence were considered. Therefore, parameters such as rainfall, groundwater, and lake area variations were measured using TRMM, GRACE, and MODIS satellite data, respectively. In order to determine and assess the relation between land deformations and environmental variations, several machine learning methods were implemented. The environmental parameters were used as the input of models and ground deformations as the target to be predicted. Eventually, ground deformations were estimated using multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, in which each network had strengths and weaknesses on different occasions. Thus, by blending the forecast of the three models, a weighted ensemble was constructed, which outperformed the single models and reached the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation (SD) of 8.2 mm, 6.4 mm, and +/- 5.2 mm, respectively. The result indicated that although each single model had proper accuracy, an ensemble model can improve land deformation anticipation using the strength of networks in various conditions.},

Yet, we lack predictive models to inform decision-making at scale.Objective: We filled this knowledge gap by developing and testing five new workability models.Methods: One model follows soil moisture-based methods (APSIM), one uses simple rain and temperature thresholds, and three follow machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Decision Table, Neural Network). We parameterized the models using USDA survey data from Iowa, USA and evaluated their temporal and spatial prediction over twelve US Corn Belt States and different time periods using multiple statistical indexes and sensitivity analysis. The models operate at a 5-arcminute resolution.Results and conclusions: Results indicated that the simple rule model, the Decision Table model, and the process -based model predicted field workable days with an agreement index of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.84, respectively for the testing datasets (n = 22,671), and hence were deemed sufficient for future use. The selected models are better suited for large timespan evaluations of workability (monthly to annual, normalized root mean square error, nRMSE = 8 to 15%)) than weekly predictions (nRMSE = 21%). The machine learning models tended to cluster their predictions around a mean value and were about 50% less responsive to precipitation than the process -based or rule-based models. We concluded that simple approaches are more robust to be applied at scale than complex approaches with many data input requirements.Significance: The developed models enhance our capacity to predict climate change impacts on workability, a valuable indicator for decision-making and overall sustainability.},

   abstract = {Amplification in extreme precipitation intensity and frequency can cause severe flooding and impose significant social and economic consequences. Variations in extreme precipitation intensity, frequencies, and return periods can be attributed to many physical variables across spatial and temporal scales. Here we employ ensemble machine learning (ML) methods, namely random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and artificial neural networks (ANN), to explore key contributing variables to monthly extreme precipitation intensity and frequency in six regions over the United States. We further establish emulators for return periods. Results show that the ML models for intensity perform better in regions with obvious seasonality (i.e., Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, and West Coast) than the other three regions (Northeast, Southwest, and Rocky Mountains), while for frequency the models perform well for most regions. The Shapley additive explanation is used to help explain the relationships between extreme precipitation characteristics and identify top variables for RF and XGB. We find that latent heat flux, relative humidity, soil moisture, and large-scale subsidence are key common variables across the regions for both monthly intensity and frequency, and their compound effects are non-negligible. The developed ML models capture the probability and return period of extreme precipitation well for all regions and may be used for decision making (e.g., infrastructure planning and design).},

   abstract = {Accurate high-resolution soil moisture mapping is critical for surface studies as well as climate change research. Currently, regional soil moisture retrieval primarily focuses on a spatial resolution of 1 km, which is not able to provide effective information for environmental science research and agricultural water resource management. In this study, we developed a quantitative retrieval framework for high-resolution (250 m) regional soil moisture inversion based on machine learning, multisource data fusion, and in situ measurement data. Specifically, we used various data sources, including the normalized vegetation index, surface temperature, surface albedo, soil properties data, precipitation data, topographic data, and soil moisture products from passive microwave data assimilation as input parameters. The soil moisture products simulated based on ground model simulation were used as supplementary data of the in situ measurements, together with the measured data from the Maqu Observation Network as the training target value. The study was conducted in the Zoige region of the Tibetan Plateau during the nonfreezing period (May-October) from 2009 to 2018, using random forests for training. The random forest model had good accuracy, with a correlation coefficient of 0.885, a root mean square error of 0.024 m(3)/m(3), and a bias of -0.004. The ground-measured soil moisture exhibited significant fluctuations, while the random forest prediction was more accurate and closely aligned with the field soil moisture compared to the soil moisture products based on ground model simulation. Our method generated results that were smoother, more stable, and with less noise, providing a more detailed spatial pattern of soil moisture. Based on the permutation importance method, we found that topographic factors such as slope and aspect, and soil properties such as silt and sand have significant impacts on soil moisture in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. This highlights the importance of fine-scale topographic and soil property information for generating high-precision soil moisture data. From the perspective of inter-annual variation, the soil moisture in this area is generally high, showing a slow upward trend, with small spatial differences, and the annual average value fluctuates between 0.3741 m(3)/m(3) and 0.3943 m(3)/m(3). The intra-annual evolution indicates that the monthly mean average soil moisture has a large geographical variation and a small multi-year linear change rate. These findings can provide valuable insights and references for regional soil moisture research.},

However, due to the spatial-temporal variability of rainfall amounts, it is very difficult to achieve high precision in the forecasts. This research addresses the challenge of rainfall forecasting by proposing the application of a methodology based on a combination of techniques within the framework of wavelet decomposition principles, the machine learning approach, and a lagged regression model. We implemented wavelet decomposition in a preprocessing phase followed by the use of a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and proposed a prediction enhancement phase in which the outputs were optimized by algorithms for monthly rainfall forecast corrections. The methodology was implemented at four weather stations in Venezuela, and it was compared with transfer function models, multiple regression and other powerful forecasting methods. The research results suggest that our approach improved the performance accuracy by correcting rainfall forecasting biases, achieving adjusted coefficients of determination greater than 0.76 and normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) values less than 0.31.},

Due to the non-linear relationship between input data and output conditions, rainfall prediction is hard, so deep neural network (DNN) models substitute for costly, complex systems. Deep neural network-based weather forecasting models can be designed quickly and cheaply to predict rainfall. On the other hand, water levels depend on rainfall. Unpredictable rainfall due to climate change might cause floods or droughts. Many individuals, especially farmers, rely on rain forecasts. In our study, we focus on the area of marshes in southern Iraq, some of the most famous landmarks in the area (and the world), where the Shatt al-Arab flows into the Arabic Gulf and the Tigris and Euphrates rivers developed within the Mesopotamian plain to create a natural balance. Since the beginning of the 1980s, the wetlands, sometimes known as “the marshes,” have experienced droughts. And by the late 1990s, a sizable portion of the marshes had dried up, leaving the arid and salty Sabkha lands void of life, particularly lands with vast bodies of water and high levels of human activity. Moreover, the corresponding regions have undergone visible hydrological and climatic changes. In this study focuses on the marshes of southern Iraq and aims to develop a rainfall forecasting model. We propose a novel approach based on optimized LSTM and hybrid deep learning algorithms to improve the forecasting of average monthly rainfall. To evaluate the efficiency of the predictions, a comparison of the predicted rainfall and the actual recorded rainfall is made, and the performance and accuracy of the models are examined. The hybrid convolutional stacked bidirectional long-short term memory (CNN-BDLSTMs) outperformed the other models.},

Monthly precipitation composites for the first harmonic, covering 24-month ENSO events, are formed for all climate divisions over the United States spanning up to 29 ENSO episodes. From the harmonic vectorial maps plotted on the study area, each vector reveals both intensity and temporal phase of the ENSO-related precipitation teleconnection, and the corresponding candidate and core regions are determined using a machine learning technique of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based on magnitude and temporal phase of climate signal, and Ko center dot ppen climate classification. As a result of vectorial mapping, five core regions were designated as North-West region (NW), South-West region (SW), Middle-Inland region (MI), South-East region (SE), and North-East region (NE). During fall (0) to spring (+) seasons, the results of this analysis show below (above) normal precipitation response to the El Nin similar to o events at the NW region (SW, MI, SE, and NE regions), while the opposite patterns are detected for the cold phase of ENSO. The temporal consistency values were 0.72 to 0.86 (0.77 to 0.82), and spatial coherence values ranged from 0.96 to 0.99 (0.94 to 0.99) for the warm (cold) events. Comparative analyses of precipitation responses to both El Nin similar to o and La Nin similar to a events reveal the high significance level of the ENSO-related precipitation signals with an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation anomalies. Positive precipitation anomalies during the El Nin similar to o thermal forcing are more significant than negative precipitation departures during the La Nin similar to a events. Consequently, middle latitude precipitation responses to the El Nin similar to o/La Nin similar to a phenomena are detectable over the contiguous United States.},

However, it is difficult to validate the GCM results and assess the uncertainty of the predictions. The observed changes in climate may be very different from the GCM results. We aim to utilize trends in observed climate dynamics to predict future risks of Aedes albopictus in China.MethodsWe collected Ae. albopictus surveillance data and observed climate records from 80 meteorological stations from 1970 to 2021. We analyzed the trends in climate change in China and made predictions on future climate for the years 2050 and 2080 based on trend analyses. We analyzed the relationship between climatic variables and the prevalence of Ae. albopictus in different months/seasons. We built a classification tree model (based on the average of 999 runs of classification and regression tree analyses) to predict the monthly/seasonal Ae. albopictus distribution based on the average climate from 1970 to 2000 and assessed the contributions of different climatic variables to the Ae. albopictus distribution. Using these models, we projected the future distributions of Ae. albopictus for 2050 and 2080.ResultsThe study included Ae. albopictus surveillance from 259 sites in China found that winter to early spring (November-February) temperatures were strongly correlated with Ae. albopictus prevalence (prediction accuracy ranges 93.0-98.8%)-the higher the temperature the higher the prevalence, while precipitation in summer (June-September) was important predictor for Ae. albopictus prevalence. The machine learning tree models predicted the current prevalence of Ae. albopictus with high levels of agreement (accuracy > 90% and Kappa agreement > 80% for all 12 months). Overall, winter temperature contributed the most to Ae. albopictus distribution, followed by summer precipitation. An increase in temperature was observed from 1970 to 2021 in most places in China, and annual change rates varied substantially from -0.22 oC/year to 0.58 oC/year among sites, with the largest increase in temperature occurring from February to April (an annual increase of 1.4-4.7 oC in monthly mean, 0.6-4.0 oC in monthly minimum, and 1.3-4.3 oC in monthly maximum temperature) and the smallest in November and December. Temperature increases were lower in the tropics/subtropics (1.5-2.3 oC from February-April) compared to the high-latitude areas (2.6-4.6 oC from February-April). The projected temperatures in 2050 and 2080 by this study were approximately 1-1.5 degrees C higher than those projected by GCMs. The estimated current Ae. albopictus risk distribution had a northern boundary of north-central China and the southern edge of northeastern China, with a risk period of June-September. The projected future Ae. albopictus risks in 2050 and 2080 cover nearly all of China, with an expanded risk period of April-October. The current at-risk population was estimated to be 960 million and the future at-risk population was projected to be 1.2 billion.ConclusionsThe magnitude of climate change in China is likely to surpass GCM predictions. Future dengue risks will expand to cover nearly all of China if current climate trends continue.},

The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-coverage dataset was applied to improve the streamflow estimate. In addition to the DDMs, the conceptual snowmelt runoff model was applied to simulate and forecast daily streamflow. The four main predictor variables, namely snow-coverage (S-C), precipitation (P), maximum temperature (T-max), and minimum temperature (T-min), and their corresponding values for each river basin, were obtained from National Climatic Data Center and National Snow and Ice Data Center to develop the model. The most relevant predictor variable was chosen using the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination feature selection approach. The results show that incorporating the MODIS snow-coverage dataset improves the models' prediction accuracies in the snowmelt-dominated basin. SVR and LSTM exhibited the best performances (root mean square error = 8.63 and 9.80) using monthly and daily snowmelt time series, respectively. In summary, machine learning is a reliable method to forecast runoff as it can be employed in global climate forecasts that require high-volume data processing.},

Machine learning (ML) is extensively used for forecasting monthly EP, and improvements in model performance have been a popular issue. The innovation of this study is summarized as follows. First, a distance correlation-Pearson correlation (DC-PC) method was proposed to identify the complex nonlinear relationship between global sea surface temperature (SST) and EP and select key input factors from SST. Second, a random forest (RF) model was used for forecasting monthly EP, and the physical mechanism of EP was obtained based on the feature importance (FI) of RF and DC-PC relationship. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR) were selected as a case study, and monthly EP in summer (June, July and August) was forecasted. Furthermore, the physical mechanism between key predictors with a large proportion of FI and EP was investigated. Results showed that the proposed model had high accuracy and robustness, in which R-2 in the test period was above 0.81, and RMSE as well as MAE were below 10 mm. Meanwhile, the key predictors in the high SST years could cause eastward extension of the South Asian High, westward extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High, water vapor rising motion and an increase in the duration of atmospheric rivers exceeding 66 h, which lead to increasing EP in the MLYR. The results indicated that the DC-PC method could replace Pearson correlation for investigating the nonlinear relationship between SST and EP, as well as for selecting the factors. Further, the key predictors that account for a large proportion of FI can be used for explaining the physical mechanism of EP and directing forecasts.},

The problems will be acute in the coming years because of the increase in frequency and intensity of hydrologic extremes due to climate change. Therefore, streamflow prediction has become an important area of research because of its importance in flood mitigation, reservoir operation, and water resource management. In this paper, we have tested four Machine Learning models (ML models): Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) for streamflow prediction at daily and monthly time scales in three rivers draining in the different climatic and geological settings. The SVM, RF, LSTM, and MARS models have been trained and tested in the Suvarna, Aghanashini, and Kunderu River Basins in peninsular India. Model intercomparison was made to identify the best suitable model for streamflow prediction. The RF outperforms other models for daily streamflow, and MARS outperforms other models for monthly streamflow prediction in the Suvarna river with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.676 and 0.924, respectively. SVM (NSE = 0.741) and RF (NSE = 0.826) are found to be the best models for daily and monthly streamflow prediction in the Aghanashini river. MARS outperformed other models in the case of high, severe, and extreme flow simulation with NSE values of 0.481, 0.374, and 0.455, respectively, in the Aghanashini river.

   abstract = {This research study investigates the use of artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and ANFIS for monthly streamflow forecasting in the Hunza river basin of Pakistan. Different models were developed using precipitation, temperature, and discharge data. Two statistical performance indicators, i.e. RMSE and R-2, were used to assess the performance of machine learning techniques. Based on these performance indicators, the ANN model predicts monthly streamflow more accurately than the RNN and ANFIS models. To assess the performance of the ANN model, three architectures were used, namely 2-1-1, 2-2-1, and 2-3-1. The ANN architecture with a 2-3-1 configuration had higher R-2 values of 0.9522 and 0.96998 for the training and testing phases, respectively. For each RNN architecture, three transfer functions were used, namely Tan-sig, Log-sig, and Purelin. The architecture with a 2-1-1 configuration based on tan-sig transfer function performed well in terms of R-2 values, which were 0.7838 and 0.8439 for the training and testing phases, respectively. For the ANFIS model, the R-2 values were 0.7023 and 0.7538 for both the training and testing phases, respectively. Overall, the findings suggest that the ANN model with a 2-3-1 architecture is the most effective for predicting monthly streamflow in the Hunza river basin.},

   abstract = {Accurate forecasting of monthly precipitation is of great significance for national production, disaster prevention and mitigation, and water resources allocation management. However, it is difficult for individual models to accurately accomplish the task of predicting precipitation, and there is also the problem of insufficient accuracy of peak and trough prediction. Therefore, to solve this problem, this paper will provide a CEEMDAN-SVM-LSTM model that combines a fully adaptive noise ensemble empirical modal decomposition (CEEMDAN),a support vector machine (SVM) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The CEEMDAN algorithm is first used to decompose the precipitation time series data into different modal components, the SVM model is then applied to the first modal component and the LSTM is applied to the remaining modal components. The precipitation data of Lanzhou city is taken as an example and brought into the model for testing and comparing with the performance of single LSTM model, differential integrated moving average autoregressive model (ARIMA), back propagation (BP) neural network model,support vector machine(SVM), extreme gradient boosting(XGBOOST), CEEMDAN-LSTM model and CEEMDAN-SVM model. After the experimental verification, the CEEMDAN-SVM-LSTM model effectively improves the fit between the observed and predicted values, overcomes the problem of low accuracy of peak and trough prediction, and significantly outperforms other models.},

The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) data store provides open access to monthly hydrological forecasts for up to six-months. This study aims to evaluate, for the first time, 1-to 3-month runoff forecasts using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensembles of precipitation, runoff, and temperature in 1981-2015 period over a total of 30 s-level basins in Iran. We adopted the 5th, 50th and 95th ECMWF ensemble quantiles for each variable that represent low, medium and high probability of occurrence, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis (Pca), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) via random forest (RF) model, and Bayesian Networks (BN) feature selection algorithms were used in order to reduce input variable dimension and select potential predictors to be fed to the machine learning models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models were used with Repeated K-Fold cross validation (rK-Fold CV) while model efficiency was evaluated using modified Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE'), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE), and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). Results of this study revealed that C3S runoff ensembles have the highest impact on forecast accuracy of streamflow, followed by precipitation and temperature. Overall, model performance yield a best-to-worst ranking of ANN, XGBoost, RF, MLR, and SVR with KGE' values of 0.70, 0.68, 0.66, 0.57, and 0.41, respectively. The predictive performance of all models decreased with lead times beyond 1-month, where ANN and XGBoost outperformed other models with KGE' of 0.65 for 2-month lead time and 0.60 for 3-month lead time. The three superior models of XGBoost, ANN, and RF, were employed with RFE and BN FSAs most frequently across Iran's 30 s level basins in all lead times. Almost all models in the arid central region of Iran showed the lowest performance while highest skills were achieved in the western regions of Iran. Finally, for all models and over all regions, the model performance reduced by increase in lead-time.},

   abstract = {Droughts, due to their complex nature, are difficult to predict; however, research is showing that there are often clearly defined patterns to their occurrence. The temporal aspects are usually more apparent when comparing regions with defined climatic characteristics, such as those with recognized wet or dry seasons, but recognizing these patterns can help in defining and understanding the overall processes influencing drought occurrence. Especially in the context of climate change, it is crucial to recognize temporal patterns and quantify them to help diagnose current and future event probabilities. The objective of this work is to introduce a new tool for assessing temporal patterns of streamflow drought, based on the harmonic oscillator theorem called the harmonic oscil-lator seasonal trend (HOST) model. The testing dataset consists of monthly minimal flows and drought occur-rence information calculated based on daily flows from the National Water Model (NWM) retrospective v.2.1 dataset for the period 1979-2020. The model framework allows for trend and seasonality signal decomposition as well as the extraction of the first five harmonics by means of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based machine learning algorithm. The model framework enables the extraction and evaluation of five different harmonic models based on short and long-range components as well as linear regression sloped harmonics. The results show that the best-fit models are based on two superimposed sinusoidal functions with an accuracy of around 70-90 % for streamflow drought occurrence, with different spatial parameters reflecting varied environmental conditions. The models were able to capture two patterns: (1) annual precipitation variation and (2) longer-term inertia, the latter of which is likely driven by large-scale circulation with a roughly-eight year period.},

The current study introduces a new deep learning model named convolutional neural network (CONN)- support vector machine (SVM)- Gaussian regression process (GPR) to predict daily and monthly rainfall data in Terengganu River Basin, Malaysia. The CONN-SVM-GRP model can extract the most important features automatically. The main advantage of the new model is to reflect the uncertainty values in the modelling process. The lagged rainfall values were used as the input variables to the models. The proposed CONN-SVM-GRP model successfully decreased the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of other models by 5.9%-23% at the daily scale and 20%-61% at the monthly scale. The CONN-SVM-GRP model also provided the lowest uncertainty among other models, making it a reliable tool for predicting data points and intervals. Hence, it can be concluded that CONN-SVM-GRP model contributes to the sustainable management of water resources, even when satellite data is unavailable, by using lagged values to predict rainfall. Additionally, the model extracts important features without using preprocessing methods, further improving its efficiency. Overall, the CONN-SVM-GRP model can help researchers predict rainfall, which is essential for monitoring water resources and mitigating the impacts of droughts, floods, and other natural disasters.},

   abstract = {Water allocation models (WAM) can capture complex feedbacks between water infrastructure, water supply, water demand, and water rights structure. They are an important tool for water managers to reduce conflict and aid in future water resource planning. Future streamflow reductions and shifts in timing are anticipated in snow-dominated watersheds of the western United States due to projected reductions in snow water storage. These basins tend to be water-limited and rely on groundwater to support agricultural demand. Water managers in the snow-fed, agricultural Walker River Basin (WRB) in California and Nevada use a dynamically coupled WAM and physically based groundwater flow model as a decision support tool. Large computation time is required to simulate groundwater dynamics, limiting the number of model scenarios that can feasibly be run to test alter-native management scenarios under climate change. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been used to capture complex nonlinear hydrologic dynamics in other contexts, but to our knowledge there have not been efforts to use ML to increase computational efficiency in modeling groundwater responses to agricultural water use. We use extreme gradient boosting to replace the groundwater sub-model for the WRB decision support tool, resulting in accurate estimates of reservoir storage (monthly error almost always < 5% of reservoir capacity), streamflow (total outflow errors from -3% to 20% depending on scenario) and agricultural water shortages (-12% to 18% error in total shortage depending on scenario). For comparison, we found that omitting ground-water modeling from the WAM results in a larger overprediction of outflows (2 to 58%) and underprediction in agricultural water shortages (0 to 41%) across a range of scenarios. We use this validated ML method to explore the sensitivity of agricultural water availability to a range of streamflow volumes and streamflow timings. Results indicate that agricultural water shortages are more sensitive to annual streamflow volume in comparison to shifts in streamflow timing. Our model shows that reservoirs can buffer the impact of altered flow timing on agri-cultural production, except under extreme conditions in which all precipitation falls as rain (no snow storage) and streamflow peaks in the winter. Future work will explore these thresholds in more detail. While the results here are site-specific, the methodology for coupling a WAM with a ML representation of surface-groundwater interactions can be applied to a wide variety of water resource modeling applications. These results also provide a stark example of the importance of snowpack storage and groundwater management to western US water infrastructure.},

In order to evaluate the drought-related issues that cause chaos for human well-being, drought indices have become increasingly important. In this study, the monthly precipitation data from 1964 to 2013 (about 50 years) of the Jodhpur district in the drought-prone Rajasthan state of India was used to derive the effective drought index (EDI). The machine learning models hybridized with evolutionary optimizers such as the genetic algorithm adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (GA-ANFIS) and particle swarm optimization ANFIS (PSO-ANFIS) were used in addition to the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) to predict the EDI index. Using the partial autocorrelation function (PACF), models for forecasting the monthly EDI were constructed with 2-, 3- and 5-input combinations to evaluate their outcomes based on various performance indices. The results of the different combination models were compared. With reference to 2-input and 3-input combination models, both GA-ANFIS and PSOANFIS show better performance results with R-2 = 0.75, while among the models with 5-input combination, GA-ANFIS depicts better performance results compared to other models with R-2 = 0.78. The results are presented suitably with the aid of scatter plots, Taylor's diagram and violin plots. Overall, the GA-ANFIS and PSO-ANFIS models outperformed the GRNN model.},

   abstract = {Drought's intensity and duration have increased in many regions over the last decades. However, the propagation of drought-induced water deficits through the terrestrial water cycle is not fully understood at a global scale. Here we study responses of monthly evaporation (ET) and runoff to soil moisture droughts occurring between 2001 and 2015 using independent gridded datasets based on machine learning-assisted upscaling of satellite and in-situ observations. We find that runoff and ET show generally contrasting drought responses across climate regimes. In wet regions, runoff is strongly reduced while ET is decoupled from soil moisture decreases and enhanced by sunny and warm weather typically accompanying soil moisture droughts. In drier regions, ET is reduced during droughts due to vegetation water stress, while runoff is largely unchanged as precipitation deficits are typically low in these regions and ET decreases are buffering runoff reductions. While these water flux drought responses are controlled by the large-scale climate regimes, they are additionally modulated by local vegetation characteristics. Land surface models capture the observed water cycle responses to drought in the case of runoff, but not for ET where the ET deficit (surplus) is overestimated (underestimated), related to a misrepresentation of the general soil moisture-evaporation interplay. In summary, our study illustrates how the joint analysis of machine learning-enhanced Earth observations can advance the understanding of global eco-hydrological processes, as well as the validation of land surface models.},

However, their spatial resolution is often too coarse for use in local areas or parameterization of meteorological and hydrological models at basin and plain scales. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty analysis of the downscaled monthly precipitation modeling of the CHIRPS satellite product based on rain gage station data. Five high-resolution ancillary data were used for this purpose including land surface temperature (LST), leaf area index (LAI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) extracted from the MODIS/Terra satellite database, and elevation data obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of NASA JPL satellite database. In addition, precipitation data were extracted from CHIRPS satellite data. Four machine learning models were used to model the downscaling, including support vector machine (SVM), gradient tree boost (GTB), random forest (RF), and classification and regression tree (CART). For accuracy evaluation, root mean square error (RMSE), Bias, multiplicative bias (mBias), correlation coefficient (CC), and optimum index factor (OIF) error estimators were applied. The results of the accuracy evaluation results showed that the CART and GTB models with the best performance according to the error estimators were the best models for stations at lower altitudes and latitudes (Karim Abad, Najm Abad, and Somea) and stations at higher altitudes and latitudes (Valian, Sorheh, and Fashand), respectively. The uncertainty analysis was performed using the bootstrap method. The results showed that the CART and GBT models had a more reliable estimate and lower uncertainty than the other models.

Accurate prediction of short-term climate (STC) can provide relevant departments with warnings to effectively reduce this threat. To accurately predict STC in China, this study utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly the random forest (RF) model, to evaluate the role of both natural and anthropogenic factors. Monthly temperature and precipitation data from 160 meteorological stations spanning China, as well as natural climate factors and an economic activity index, were obtained to perform a seasonal hindcast of air temperature and precipitation observed from 1979 to 2018. Our focus was to predict the seasonal mean temperature and precipitation, specifically the summer (June, July, and August (JJA)) and winter (December, January, and February (DJF)) air temperature and precipitation anomalies using forecast factors from the preceding season. Results show that a comprehensive consideration of both natural and anthropogenic effects provides a more accurate fit to the observed climate trends compared to using only one factor. When both factors were integrated, the model scores (coefficient of determination) exceeded 0.95, close to 1.00, which is significantly higher than those of natural (0.86 for temperature, 0.85 for precipitation) or anthropogenic (0.90 for temperature and 0.50 for precipitation) factors alone. Furthermore, we also attempted to predict similar components for 2019 and 2020. The average relative error between predictions and observations was less than 10%, indicating that this integrated model's performance exhibited a significant improvement in predicting the STC. The findings of this study underscore the importance of accounting for both natural and anthropogenic factors in predicting climate trends to inform sustainable decision-making in China.},

   abstract = {Excessive use of water resources in combination with climate change threaten to significantly reduce ground-water in arid and semiarid regions. We studied the effects of climate change on the groundwater level for the important Dehgolan Aquifer in northwestern Iran. The water level in this aquifer has dropped by about 35 m during the last 30 years. Soft computing techniques were used together with climate projections in three methodological steps to estimate the groundwater level drop by 2045. Firstly, MODFLOW was used to simulate groundwater flow and movement. Secondly, simulation results, support vector regression (SVR), and least -squares SVR (LSSVR) machine learning models were used to predict groundwater levels for the future 20-year period (2026-2045). The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) was used to improve the prediction results by optimizing the SVR parameters. Thirdly, three climate models of CMIP6 (ACCESS-CM2, BCC-CSM2-MR, and CMCC-ESM2) were used to predict the changes in precipitation for the future period (2026-2045) using SSP 2.6 and SSP 8.5 scenarios. The results showed that the MODFLOW-LSSVR model predicted the groundwater level more accurately than MODFLOW-SVR and MODFLOW-SVR-WOA. The calculation scenario containing previous month groundwater level, monthly aquifer withdrawal, and monthly precipitation had the highest performance in predicting groundwater level with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) equal to 0.305 m, 0.014 m, and 0.998, respectively. The results indicate that precipitation may decrease in the future period for the SSP 8.5 scenario (about 6% compared to the reference period 1987-2005). This decrease, along with the continuation of the current aquifer withdrawal, will cause a drop of about 36 m (during 28 years) of the groundwater level (1.3 m per year). The results reveal that the drop could be reduced to 12 m by adopting a 25% reduction in the current aquifer withdrawal. The findings show the necessity of providing a suitable management approach to prevent future aquifer exhaustion due to the continuation of the current withdrawal situation in the region.},

Coarse-resolution of existing total water availability or terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data is the major limitation of their applications in different sectors. An attempt has been made to downscale Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) TWSA data to develop a high -resolution gridded data product of the total water availability of Iraq. European reanalysis (ERA5) precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, subsurface runoff and soil water contents data were used to downscale GRACE 1.0 degrees spatial resolution monthly TWSA to 0.1 degrees spatial resolution for the period 2002-2020. A machine learning (ML)-based recursive feature elimination algorithm was used to identify the optimum input combination according to the nonlinear relationship of ERA5 variables with GRACE water equivalence data. The selected subset of inputs was used to develop the downscaling models using three classical ML algorithms for the available GRACE measurement points over Iraq. The models were calibrated at 70% of GRACE grid point locations and validated in the rest of the points. Finally, the model was used to predict TWSA at each ERA5 grid point to generate Iraq's high-resolution water availability dataset. The results showed higher performance of random forest in downscaling TWSA compared to other algorithms. The model estimated the TWSA at validation points with Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) in the range of 0.5-0.91 and Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) between 0.54 and 0.88. The modelled high-resolution TWSA data shows higher availability of water resources in the north, particularly northeast of Iraq, and the least in the southeast.

   abstract = {Drought is a recurring climate phenomenon causing many environmental and agricultural problems among others. To limit drought consequences, it is essential to monitor drought and implement efficient control measures. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-month timescales for mapping the drought severity as an effective water management tool in an arid climate region. Calculations of the SPI were performed using historic records of monthly precipitation data of 50 stations over the Sistan and Baluchistan province, southeast of Iran. The majority of the SPI variants showed a moderate to strong spatial correlation with a spherical structure. In 1997, having a higher amount of rainfall, all areas across the province were in a wet or normal condition. In the years with a low rainfall amount (e.g., 2012), the western and southeastern parts of the province have been affected by different degrees of drought especially at the moderate timescales 6 and 12 months. The generated SPI maps identified the most vulnerable regions to drought over the province where government investments should be prioritized for an improved resiliency of the water management infrastructures and for designing a strategic crop management plan with less irrigation water demands.},

   abstract = {Drought is an insidious meteorological and hydrological natural phenomenon causing many adverse impacts on the environment, agriculture, and socio-economic condition, especially over a semi-arid region like Kolar and Chikkaballapura district in the state of Karnataka. When the precipitation level is inadequate to meet the demands of human activities, it leads to drought extension over a season or longer period. The present article is investigating the application of the standard precipitation index (SPI) to detect drought incidents and is widely used to understand rainfall variability. Therefore, this study attempts to analyze drought at pre-monsoon, southwest monsoon, northeast monsoon, and annual time period using SPI for Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts of Karnataka state. The outcome of this analysis demonstrates that drought occurrences are frequent in particular years and seasons with negative values of SPI along with dry, wet, and normal events. To apply any management plan with the increasing nuisance, deep knowledge is essential about meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought. The rainfall data for the period 1951–2019 at the eleven grid points were acquired from the India Meteorological Department with (0.25⁰ × 0.25⁰) high spatial resolution. The result revealed that a moderate dry event was observed in the pre-monsoon period at Kolar in 1993 with − 0.67. Extreme drought condition was recorded during the southwest monsoon season in 1980 at Kolar with − 2.22 and for the northeast monsoon, − 1.67 was observed at Malur station in 1988. The seasonal crops of the southwest monsoon (June–September) are heavily dependent on this rainfall and it contrib­ utes to 58% of the annual precipitation. If there is a drop in the rainfall received during the southwest monsoon, the effect on the growing stage of agricultural crops leads to reduced crop yield.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Inspired by neurophysiological form of brain, in addition to conventional weights and bias, an EANN includes simulated emotional parameters aimed at improving the network learning process. EANN trained by a modiﬁed version of back-propagation (BP) algorithm was applied to single and multi-step-ahead runoff forecasting of two watersheds with two distinct climatic conditions. Also to evaluate the ability of EANN trained by smaller training data set, three data division strategies with different number of training samples were considered for the training purpose. The overall comparison of the obtained results of the r-r modeling indicates that the EANN could outperform the conventional feed forward neural network (FFNN) model up to 13% and 34% in terms of training and veriﬁcation efﬁciency criteria, respectively. The superiority of EANN over classic ANN is due to its ability to recognize and distinguish dry (rainless days) and wet (rainy days) situations using hormonal parameters of the artiﬁcial emotional system.},

Six models, including the original ANN model without data preprocessing, were set up and evaluated. Five new models were ANN-MA, ANN-SSA1, ANN-SSA2, ANNWMRA1, and ANN-WMRA2. The ANN-MA was derived from the raw ANN model combined with the MA. The ANN-SSA1, ANN-SSA2, ANN-WMRA1 and ANN-WMRA2 were generated by using the original ANN model coupled with SSA and WMRA in terms of two different means. Two daily ﬂow series from different watersheds in China (Lushui and Daning) were used in six models for three prediction horizons (i.e., 1-, 2-, and 3-day-ahead forecast). The poor performance on ANN forecast models was mainly due to the existence of the lagged prediction. The ANN-MA, among six models, performed best and eradicated the lag effect. The performances from the ANN-SSA1 and ANN-SSA2 were similar, and the performances from the ANN-WMRA1 and ANN-WMRA2 were also similar. However, the models based on the SSA presented better performance than the models based on the WMRA at all forecast horizons, which meant that the SSA is more effective than the WMRA in improving the ANN performance in the current study. Based on an overall consideration including the model performance and the complexity of modeling, the ANN-MA model was optimal, then the ANN model coupled with SSA, and ﬁnally the ANN model coupled with WMRA.},

CNN can automatically extract critical features from numerous inputs with its convolution-pooling mechanism, which is a distinct advantage compared with other AI models.

This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the ﬁeld of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classiﬁcation and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-ofthe-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a uniﬁed taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets.

This study aimed to determine the landscape pattern, dynamics, intensity, and eco-climatic drivers of forest fragmentation and restoration within the last 4 decades in Old Oyo National Park (OONP), Nigeria. The data collection and analysis used field observations, and geospatial and machine learning techniques. Three-time series (1986, 2003, and 2019) of Landsat satellite imageries downloaded and subjected to supervised image classification and landscape analysis (LA). The results revealed that the mixed open savanna areas covered the highest landmass of OONP. The dense woodland and forest outlier areas (DWFOA) reduced from 579.34 km(2) (23.07%) in 1986 to 489.84 km(2) (19.50%) in 2003 and increased to 653.46 km(2) (26.02%) in 2019. LA revealed an increase in the forest fragmentation based on the number of patches and mean patch area. Twenty-six and twenty-eight out of forty-three eco-climatic variables are the most significant drivers to the changed and restored DWFOA between the year 1986 and 2019. Partial dependence plots showed a strong relationship of bush burn severity on the probability of the conversion and restoration of DWFOA. Other significant variables include distance to host communities, distance to roads, distance to rivers, elevation, average monthly rainfall (March-April, June-October), and slope. Despite the forest restoration, the evidence of forest fragmentation calls for measures to mitigate the climate change, indiscriminate bush burning and other anthropogenic pressure indicators.},

   abstract = {It is well documented that energy balance and other remote sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET) models face greater uncertainty over water-limited tree-grass ecosystems (TGEs), representing nearly 1/6th of the global land surface. Their dual vegetation strata, the grass-dominated understory and tree-dominated overstory, make for distinct structural, physiological and phenological characteristics, which challenge models compared to more homogeneous and energy-limited ecosystems. Along with this, the contribution of grasses and trees to total transpiration (T), along with their different climatic drivers, is still largely unknown nor quantified in TGEs. This study proposes a thermal-based three-source energy balance (3SEB) model, accommodating an additional vegetation source within the well-known two-source energy balance (TSEB) model. The model was implemented at both tower and continental scales using eddy-covariance (EC) TGE sites, with variable tree canopy cover and rainfall (P) regimes and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) images. 3SEB robustly simulated latent heat (LE) and related energy fluxes in all sites (Tower: LE RMSD similar to 60 W/m(2); MSG: LE RMSD similar to 90 W/m(2)), improving over both TSEB and seasonally changing TSEB (TSEB-2S) models. In addition, 3SEB inherently partitions water fluxes between the tree, grass and soil sources. The modelled T correlated well with EC T estimates (r > .76), derived from a machine learning ET partitioning method. The T/ET was found positively related to both P and leaf area index, especially compared to the decomposed grass understory T/ET. However, trees and grasses had contrasting relations with respect to monthly P. These results demonstrate the importance in decomposing total ET into the different vegetation sources, as they have distinct climatic drivers, and hence, different relations to seasonal water availability. These promising results improved ET and energy flux estimations over complex TGEs, which may contribute to enhance global drought monitoring and understanding, and their responses to climate change feedbacks.},

In Saudi Arabia (SA), agriculture relies on groundwater, seasonal water, desalinated water, and recycled water due to a lack of surface water resources, a dry environment, and scanty rainfall. Estimating water consumption to plan crop water requirements (CWR) in changing environments is difficult due to a lack of micro-level data on water consumption, particularly in agricultural systems. High-resolution satellite data combined with environmental data provides a valuable tool for computing the CWR. This study aimed to estimate the CWR with a greater spatial and temporal resolution and localized field data and environmental variables. Obtaining this at the field level is appropriate, but geospatial technology can produce repeatable, time-series phenomena and align with environmental data for wider coverage regions. The CWR in the study area has been investigated through two methods: firstly, based on the high-resolution PlanetScope (PS) data, and secondly, using the FAO CROPWAT model v8.0. The analysis revealed that evapotranspiration (ETo) showed a minimum response of 2.22 mm/day in January to a maximum of 6.13 mm/day in July, with high temperatures (42.8). The humidity reaches a peak of 51%, falling to a minimum in June of 15%. Annual CWR values (in mm) for seven crops studied in the present investigation, including date palm, wheat, citrus, maize, barley, clover, and vegetables, were 1377, 296, 964, 275, 259, 1077, 214, respectively. The monthly averaged CWR derived using PS showed a higher correlation (r = 0.83) with CROPWAT model results. The study was promising and highlighted that such analysis is decisive and can be implemented in any region by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for in-depth insights.},

In this way, the satellite-based products, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) datasets, as well as the pumping rate, are used as the predictive variables in different lag times. To obtain the optimal input combinations, the Gamma Test (GT) is employed as a non-linear feature selection technique. The spatial analysis of the performance prediction is performed using several error metrics (e.g., R-2, and NRMSE). Results indicate that the GBR provides a high prediction performance to predict the GWL, whereas the GRACE product is an accurate predictive variable. The correlation analysis between the predicted and observed GWL shows that the coefficient of determination values vary in the range of 0.66 to 0.94 over the different lead times. The spatial pattern of the prediction accuracy indicates that the regions with higher water depth and pumping rate offer higher performance. Moreover, the increasing trends in performance accuracy are observed from the north to south and the west to east of the Rafsanjan aquifer. In general, the proposed approach provides a reliable insight for water resources planner to make a decision based on the accurate modeling results.},

However, its utilization in electrical power grid systems can be very challenging regarding rates predictably. Renewable energy depends mainly on environmental conditions such as rainfall-runoff ratios and temperature. Because of that, the expected power production heavily fluctuates, which makes the prediction and calculation of feed-in into the power grid very challenging. The accurate forecasting of energy production is a very crucial issue for power management process. This paper presents the results of deploying Machine Learning Techniques in short-term forecasting of the amount of energy produced of General Circulation Models (GCMs) Data by Almus Dam and Hydroelectric Power Plant in Tokat, Turkey. The study demonstrates the use of modeling techniques in hydropower forecasting process using the predicted monthly hydroelectric power generation data of GCMs from 2018 to 2080. Decision Tree, Deep Learning, Generalized Linear, Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forest models are utilized to forecast the hydropower production. The results show that the correlation value of the gradient boosted trees model equals 0.717, which means that the gradient boosted trees model is the most successful model for the present data. The gradient boosted trees model used in the prediction process for each GCM in each scenario is 4.5 and 8.5. The results show that there are small differences between the models, which means that the predictions are going in similar directions for all these models.},

   abstract = {River water quality is a function of various bio-physicochemical parameters which can be aggregated for calculating the Water Quality Index (WQI). However, it is challenging to model the nonlinearity and uncertain behavior of these parameters. When data is deficient and noisy, it creates missing and conflicting parameters within their complex inter-relationships. It is also essential to model how climatic variations and river discharge affect water quality. The present study proposes a cloud-based efficient and resourceful machine learning (ML) modeling framework using an artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and advanced particle swarm optimization (PSO). The framework assesses the sensitivity of five critical water quality parameters namely biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, and total coliform toward WQI of the River Ganges in India. Monthly datasets of these parameters, river flow, and climate components (rainfall and temperature) for a nine-year (2011-2019) period have been used to build the models. We also propose collecting the data by placing various monitoring sensors in the river and sending the data to the cloud for analysis. This helps in continuous monitoring and analysis. Results indicate that ANN and ANFIS capture the nonlinearity in the relationship among water quality parameters with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.5 x 10(-7) (0.002%) and 1.02 x 10(-5) (0.029%), respectively, while the combined ANN-PSO model gives normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.0024.

   abstract = {Global climate models (GCMs) are useful tools for assessing climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Although climate data from various GCMs have been increasingly used in climate change impact studies, GCMs configurations and module characteristics vary from one to another. Therefore, it is crucial to assess different GCMs to confirm the extent to which they can reproduce the observed temperature and rainfall. Rather than assessing the interdependence of each GCM, the purpose of this study is to compare the capacity of four different multi-model ensemble (MME) methods (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], Bayesian model averaging [BMA] and the arithmetic ensemble mean [EM]) in reproducing observed monthly rainfall and temperature. Of these four methods, the RF and SVM demonstrated a significant improvement over EM and BMA in terms of performance criteria. The relative importance of each GCM based on the RF ensemble in reproducing rainfall and temperature could also be ranked. We compared the GCMs importance and Taylor skill score and found that their correlation was 0.95 for temperature and 0.54 for rainfall. Our results also demonstrated that the number of GCMs ensemble simulations could be reduced from 33 to 25 in RF model while maintaining predictive error less than 2%. Having such a representative subset of simulations could reduce computational costs for climate impact modelling and maintain the quality of ensemble at the same time. We conclude that machine learning MME could be efficient and useful with improved accuracy in reproducing historical climate variables.},

   abstract = {Long lead-time streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management in both the short and long terms. Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.},

   abstract = {Estimating monthly runoff variation, especially in ungauged basins, is inevitable for water resource planning and management. The present study aimed to evaluate the regionalization methods for determining regional parameters of the rainfall-runoff model (i.e., GR2M model). Two regionalization methods (i.e., regression-based methods and distance-based methods) were investigated in this study. Three regression-based methods were selected including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), and M5 Model Tree (M5), and two distance-based methods included Spatial Proximity Approach and Physical Similarity Approach (PSA). Hydrological data and the basin's physical attributes were analyzed from 37 runoff stations in Thailand's southern basin. The results showed that using hydrological data for estimating the GR2M model parameters is better than using the basin's physical attributes. RF had the most accuracy in estimating regional GR2M model's parameters by giving the lowest error, followed by M5, MLR, SPA, and PSA. Such regional parameters were then applied in estimating monthly runoff using the GR2M model. Then, their performance was evaluated using three performance criteria, i.e., Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Correlation Coefficient (r), and Overall Index (OI). The regionalized monthly runoff with RF performed the best, followed by SPA, M5, MLR, and PSA. The Taylor diagram was also used to graphically evaluate the obtained results, which indicated that RF provided the products closest to GR2M's results, followed by SPA, M5, PSA, and MLR. Our finding revealed the applicability of machine learning for estimating monthly runoff in the ungauged basins. However, the SPA would be recommended in areas where lacking the basin's physical attributes and hydrological information.},

In this work, we developed a streamflow model to determine whether floods and rainfall anomalies explain variations in rural trail bridge use, as directly measured by in-situ motion-activated digital cameras. Flooding data and river flows upon which our investigation relies are not readily available because most of the rivers that are the focus of this study are ungauged. We developed a streamflow model for these rivers by exploring the performance of process-based and machine learning models. We then selected the best model to estimate streamflow at each bridge site to enable an investigation of the associations between weather events and pedestrian volumes collected from motion-activated cameras. The Gradient Boosting Machine model (GBM) had the highest skill with a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) score of 0.79 followed by the Random Forest model (RFM) and the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with KGE scores of 0.73 and 0.66, respectively. The physically-based Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC) had a KGE score of 0.07. At the 50% flow exceedance threshold, the GBM model predicted 90% of flood events reported between 2013 and 2022. We found moderate to strong positive correlations between total monthly crossings and the total number of flood events at four of the seven bridge sites (r = 0.36-0.84), and moderate negative correlations at the remaining bridge sites (r = -0.33- -0.53). Correlation with monthly rainfall was generally moderate to high with one bridge site showing no correlation and the rest having correlations ranging between 0.15-0.76. These results reveal an association between weather events and mobility and support the scaling up of the trail bridge program to mitigate flood risks. The paper concludes with recommendations for the improvement of streamflow and flood prediction in Rwanda in support of community-based flood early warning systems connected to trail bridges.},

The results reveal that (i) compared with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep belief network (DBN), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), the stacked machine learning model has a better ability to simulate the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and influencing factors, with higher accuracy and a lower error rate. (ii) There was significant spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity of the PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province from October 2015 to September 2020, and the regional and clustering characteristics of air pollution are obvious, with PM2.5 concentrations mainly showing high-high clustering and low-low clustering. (iii) The key influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations differ by month. Therefore, identifying the key influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations in Sichuan Province in different months is crucial for the accurate management of air quality. (iv) The influence of interacting factors on PM2.5 concentrations varied by month. Therefore, the identification of key interaction factors influencing PM2.5 concentrations in Sichuan Province on a monthly time scale can provide some scientific evidence to support PM2.5 pollution prevention and control.},

Five machine learning algorithms are used with combinations of predictors, such as standardized anomaly of rainfall, pH, electrical conductivity and water quality index of spring water. The discharge and predictor parameters are used from a total of 06 springs distributed across the watershed, and monitored during January, 2019 to December, 2020 at monthly interval. Due to asymmetric relationships between model predictors and spring discharge, model performances are tested for the predictor time lags of 0-2 (= 60 days). A total of ten experiments are carried out, and model performances during training and testing are evaluated using receiver operator characteristics. The discriminant analysis classifier, in combination with rainfall and electrical conductivity as predictors, is found to be the best model for predicting spring high-flows.},

This new hybrid method was then evaluated by considering four general scenarios. In the first scenario, the modeling process is initiated without preprocessing input data as a base case. While in other three scenarios, the one-step and two-step procedures are utilized to make the model predictions more precise. The mentioned scenarios are based on a combination of stationarization techniques (i.e., differencing, seasonal and non-seasonal standardization and spectral analysis), and normality transforms (i.e., Box-Cox, John and Draper, Yeo and Johnson, Johnson, Box-Cox-Mod, log, log standard, and Manly). In scenario 2, which is a one-step scenario, the stationarization methods are employed as preprocessing approaches. In scenario 3 and 4, different combinations of normality transform, and stationarization methods are considered as preprocessing techniques. In total, 61 sub-scenarios are evaluated resulting 11013 models (10785 linear methods, 4 nonlinear models, and 224 hybrid models are evaluated). The uncertainty of the linear, nonlinear and hybrid models are examined by Monte Carlo technique. The best preprocessing technique is the utilization of Johnson normality transform and seasonal standardization (respectively) (R-2 = 0.99; RMSE = 0.6; MAE = 0.38; RMSRE = 0.1, MARE = 0.06, UI = 0.03 & UII = 0.05). The results of uncertainty analysis indicated the good performance of proposed technique (d-factor = 0.27; 95PPU = 83.57).

   abstract = {Estimating maximum possible rainfall is of great value for flood prediction and protection, particularly for regions, such as Canada, where urban and fluvial floods from extreme rainfalls have been known to be a major concern. In this study, a methodology is proposed to forecast real-time rainfall (with one month lead time) using different number of spatial inputs with different orders of lags. For this purpose, two types of models are used. The first one is a machine learning data driven-based model, which uses a set of hydrologic variables as inputs, and the second one is an empirical-statistical model that employs the multi-criteria decision analysis method for rainfall forecasting. The data driven model is built based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the developed multi-criteria decision analysis model uses Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. A comprehensive set of spatially varying climate variables, including geopotential height, sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, humidity, temperature and pressure with different orders of lags is collected to form input vectors for the forecast models. Then, a feature selection method is employed to identify the most appropriate predictors. Two sets of results from the developed models, i.e., maximum daily rainfall in each month (RMAX) and cumulative value of rainfall for each month (RCU), are considered as the target variables for forecast purpose. The results from both modeling approaches are compared using a number of evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). The proposed models are applied for rainfall forecasting for a coastal area in Western Canada: Vancouver, British Columbia. Results indicate although data driven models such as ANNs work well for the simulation purpose, developed TOPSIS model considerably outperforms ANNs for the rainfall forecasting. ANNs show acceptable simulation performance during the calibration period (NSE up to 0.9) but they fail for the validation (NSE of 0.2) and forecasting (negative NSE). The TOPSIS method delivers better rainfall forecasting performance with the NSE of about 0.7. Moreover, the number of predictors that are used in the TOPSIS model are significantly less than those required by the ANNs to show an acceptable performance (7 against 47 for forecasting RCU and 6 against 32 for forecasting RMAX). Reliable and precise rainfall forecasting, with adequate lead time, benefits enhanced flood warning and decision making to reduce potential flood damages.},

   abstract = {This study modelled the relationships between vegetation response and available water below the soil surface using Terra's moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and soil water content (SWC). The Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) interface known as ArcSWAT was used in ArcGIS for the groundwater analysis. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated in SWAT-CUP software using 10 years (2001-2010) of monthly streamflow data. The average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency during the calibration and validation was 0.54 and 0.51, respectively, indicating that the model performances were good. Nineteen years (2002-2020) of monthly MODIS NDVI data for three different types of vegetation (forest, shrub, and grass) and soil water content for 43 sub-basins were analysed using the WEKA, machine learning tool with a selection of two supervised machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The modelling results show that different types of vegetation response and soil water content vary in the dry and wet seasons. For example, the model generated high positive relationships (r = 0.76, 0.73, and 0.81) between the measured and predicted NDVI values of all vegetation in the sub-basin against the groundwater flow (GW), soil water content (SWC), and combination of these two variables, respectively, during the dry season. However, these relationships were reduced by 36.8% (r = 0.48) and 13.6% (r = 0.63) against GW and SWC, respectively, in the wet season. Our models also predicted that vegetation in the top location (upper part) of the sub-basin is highly responsive to GW and SWC (r = 0.78, and 0.70) during the dry season. Although the rainfall pattern is highly variable in the study area, the summer rainfall is very effective for the growth of the grass vegetation type. The results predicted that the growth of vegetation in the top-point location is highly dependent on groundwater flow in both the dry and wet seasons, and any instability or long-term drought can negatively affect these floodplain vegetation communities. This study has enriched our knowledge of vegetation responses to groundwater in each season, which will facilitate better floodplain vegetation management.},

Monthly rainfall erosivity index (REI) composites for the first harmonic, covering 24-month ENSO events, are formed for all climate divisions over the United States spanning up to 29 ENSO episodes. From the harmonic vectorial maps plotted on the study area, each vector reveals both intensity and temporal phase of the ENSO-related REI teleconnection, and the corresponding candidate and core regions are determined using a machine learning technique of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based on magnitude and temporal phase of climate signal, and Ko center dot ppen climate classification. As a result of vectorial mapping, five core regions were designated as the northwest (NW), the north central (NC), the northeast coastal (NEC), the southeast (SE), and the southwest/middle-inland (SWM) regions. During fall (0) to spring (+) seasons, the results of this analysis show negative (positive) rainfall erosivity response to the El Nin similar to o events at the NW and NC regions (NEC, SE, and SWM regions), while the opposite patterns are detected for the cold phase of ENSO. The temporal consistency values were 0.62 to 0.86 (0.73 to 0.82), and spatial coherence values ranged from 0.93 to 0.98 (0.94 to 0.97) for the El Nin similar to o (La Nin similar to a) events. Comparative analyses of rainfall erosivity responses to both warm and cold ENSO events reveal the high significance level of the ENSO-REI correlation with an opposite tendency in monthly rainfall erosivity anomalies. Above normal rainfall erosivity anomalies during the El Nin similar to o thermal forcing are more significant than below normal rainfall erosivity departures during the La Nin similar to a events. Consequently, middle latitude rainfall erosivity responses to the El Nin similar to o and La Nin similar to a phenomena are detectable over the contiguous United States.},

Using machine learning techniques viz., cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), the spatial and temporal rainfall patterns over the meteorological subdivisions in India are examined. Monthly rainfall data of 117 years (1901-2017) from India Meteorological Department over 36 meteorological subdivisions in India is used in this study. Using hierarchical clustering method, six homogeneous rainfall clusters were identified in India. Among the rainfall clusters, Group 1 had 30% dissimilarity with Groups 2, 3, and 4 while Group 5 and Group 6 are highly dissimilar (more than 90% dissimilarity) with the rest of the groups. Rainfall seasons in each group were further classified into dry, wet, and transition periods. The duration of dry period is smaller in group which consists of subdivisions from southern part of the country. The transition period between dry and wet period was found to be smaller for subdivisions in the coastal region. Both CA and PCA showed high rainfall variability in Groups 5 and 6, which comprise subdivisions from north east, Kerala, Konkan, and costal Karnataka and low rainfall variability in Groups 1 and 2 which comprise subdivisions from east, north, and central part of the country. Strong negative trend in annual and Indian summer monsoon rainfall is seen in northeast India and Kerala while positive trend is observed over costal Karnataka and Konkan region. The negative trend in post monsoon rainfall particularly over the peninsular and northeast India indicates weakening of northeast monsoon rainfall in the country.},

   abstract = {India is facing the worst water crisis in its history and major Indian cities which accommodate about 50% of its population will be among highly groundwater stressed cities by 2020. In past few decades, the urban groundwater resources declined significantly due to over exploitation, urbanization, population growth and climate change. To understand the role of these variables on groundwater level fluctuation, we developed a machine learning based modelling approach considering singular spectrum analysis (SSA), mutual information theory (Ml), genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The developed approach was used to predict the groundwater levels in Bengaluru, a densely populated city with declining groundwater water resources. The input data which consist of groundwater levels, rainfall, temperature, NOI, SOI NINO3 and monthly population growth rate were pre-processed using mutual information theory, genetic algorithm and lag analysis. Later, the optimized input sets were used in ANN and SVM to predict monthly groundwater level fluctuations. The results suggest that the machine learning based approach with data pre-processing predict groundwater levels accurately (R > 85%). It is also evident from the results that the pre-processing techniques enhance the prediction accuracy and results were improved for 66% of the monitored wells. Analysis of various input parameters suggest, inclusion of population growth rate is positively correlated with decrease in groundwater levels. The developed approach in this study for urban groundwater prediction can be useful particularly in cities where lack of pipeline/sewage/drainage lines leakage data hinders physical based modelling.

In addition, the teleconnections over the two regions have differing origins. The teleconnection features associated with rainfall anomalies over west Japan have origins in the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans, whereas those over east Japan are associated with high-latitude SST anomalies. The early summer (winter) rainfall over west Japan is linked to the El Nino Modoki (La Nina Modoki) phenomena, whereas the early summer and winter rainfall anomalies over east Japan are associated with the SST anomaly over the eastern subtropical Pacific and South Pacific oceans, respectively. Having identified the teleconnections, prediction model approaches-a machine-learning approach, namely support vector regression (SVR), and a hybrid graphical modelling/C-Vine copula (GM-Copula)-were developed to forecast the rainfall over both east and west Japan. The predictors were derived from the monthly SST anomalies at different lags (1-6 months), and whereas the hidden, nonlinear relationship was well captured by the SVR approach, the complex association was decidedly better captured by the GM-Copula approach. Hence, it is recommended for forecasting the rainfall over east and west Japan.},

This study utilized two multivariate polynomial regressions (MPR) and twelve machine learning algorithms, namely three artificial neural networks (ANN), four adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and five support vec-tor machine (SVM) algorithms, to estimate monthly and annual rainfalls in a tropical loca-tion. The ground measured rainfall data were collected from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET), Lagos spanning 31 years (1983-2013) spatially distributed across Nigeria. The proposed models employed geoclimatic coordinates such as longitude, latitude, and altitude as input variables. Analyses based on general performance index (c) showed that the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model's algorithms outscored the MPR, ANN and SVM models in the ten months of the year. Its the generalized bell-shaped al-gorithm (ANFIS-GBELL) performed best for January, April, May, July, October and annual rainfalls, the Gaussian algorithm (ANFIS-GAUSS) for November and December, the subtrac-tive clustered algorithms (ANFIS-SC) for August and September rainfalls, and fuzzy c-means algorithms (ANFIS-FCM) for June rainfall. Also, the multivariate polynomial regression of second order (MPR-2) model performed best for February and March rainfalls. These mod-els' algorithms have general performance index ranging from 0.906 to 0.996 and they are thereby proposed for the estimation of rainfall amounts over Nigeria.},

   abstract = {Globally, extreme rainfall has intense impacts on ecosystems and human livelihoods. However, no effort has yet been made to forecast the extreme rainfall indices through machine learning techniques. In this paper, a new extreme rainfall indices forecasting model is proposed using a random forest (RF) model to provide effective forecasts of monthly extreme rainfall indices. In addition, RF feature importance is proposed in this study to identify the most and least important features for the proposed model. This study forecasts only statistically significant extreme rainfall indices over Bangladesh including consecutive dry days (CDD), the number of heavy rain days (R10mm; rainfall >= 10 mm), and the number of heavy rain days (R20mm; rainfall >= 20 mm) within 1-3 months of lead time. The proposed model uses monthly antecedent CDD, R10mm, and R20mm including atmospheric parameters and ocean-atmospheric teleconnections, namely, convective available potential energy (CAPE), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (TEM), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), as the inputs to the model. Results show that the proposed model yields the best performance to forecast CDD, R10mm, and R20mm with only the antecedent of these indices as input. Ocean-atmospheric teleconnections (IOD, ENSO, and NAO) are useful for CDD forecasting, and local atmospheric parameters (CAPE, RH, and TEM) are useful for R10mm and R20mm forecasting. The results suggest that adding atmospheric parameters and ocean-atmospheric teleconnections is useful to forecast extreme rainfall indices.},

   abstract = {Forecasting the rainfall is one of the most important issues in the hydrological cycle. It is very challenging because is still unable to get an ideal model given its uncertain and unexpected variation. Therefore, the study reviewed previous scientific studied from 2000 to 2020 associated with predicting the rainfall in Northern Cyprus and worldwide using machine learning models or mathematical regressions. According to this review, it is evident that the response surface regression (RSR) model has not yet been considered in other studies about monthly rainfall prediction. Consequently, this paper is examined the performance of the RSR for monthly rainfall prediction and compared with the most prominent rainfall artificial model (feed-forward neural network) and multiple linear regression (MLR). In this work, geographical coordinates (latitude (L), longitude (Lo), and altitude (AL) of the location) and meteorological parameters (average temperature (AT), maximum temperature (MaxT), minimum temperature (MinT), and relative humidity (Rh)) are considered as input variables for the models. Rainfall (R) is considered as an output variable for all models. The meteorological data were collected from seven meteorological stations distributed over Northern Cyprus for a short-term period (2011-2017). The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and Willmott's index of agreement (d) were used to select the best predictive model. The results demonstrate that the developed ANN model is superior in predicting the value of monthly rainfall with reported values of 0.631, 33.404, 0.625, and 0.880 for the parameters of R-2, RMSE, NSE, and d, respectively. Additionally, the results indicate that the RSR model gave better represent the relationship between the geographical coordinates, meteorological parameters, and rainfall and produce a better prediction of the monthly rainfall compared to MLR.},

   abstract = {Due to its high topographic gradients and climatic conditions, the Colombian Andean Region (CAR) has been associated with human and economic losses caused by rainfall-triggered landslides over time; for this reason, the definition of the rainfall conditions that trigger landslides has received significant research interest. However, numerous areas that constitute this region do not have ground-rainfall gauge networks to correlate rainfall and landslides. In this sense, the information provided by Satellite Rainfall Estimations (SREs) can help address this deficiency. Therefore, this work aimed to propose a methodology to spatialise the rainfall-triggered landslide hazard over the Andean Region using conditioning variables, SREs (CHIRPSv2 and MSWEPv2.6), and commonly used ground-rainfall gauges. Thus, the performance of the selected SREs is assessed using the modified Kling Gupta efficiency Metric (KGE’) and its components. Subsequently, the Random Forest Model (RFM) was trained for the 1981–2019 period, and its performance was assessed in terms of different skill scores and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC). The model's predictive capacity for rainfall-triggered landslides was also tested using input data from recent events outside the training period (2020–2021). The KGE's results showed a good correlation between rainfall estimates (CHIRPSv2 and MSWEPv2.6) and observations (ground-rainfall gauges) for accumulated rainfall scales greater than three days, being better at the monthly and annual scales (KGE'>0.5). In addition, the performance of the RFM was good in all evaluated cases (ROC-AUC>0.78), with the ground-rainfall database outperforming the satellite databases. The results indicated that CHIRPSv2 is the best-performing SRE for landslide prediction in the Colombian Andean Region. Finally, the landslide forecast model results proved that the RFM could predict rain-triggered landslides using only rainfall variables, providing a suitable option for Landslides Early Warning Systems (LEWS). Lastly, the model results indicated an accurate probability of occurrence using CHIRPSv2 estimations, suggesting that the model would also yield good results in areas with a scarcity of ground-rainfall data.},

In this way, the satellite-based products, including the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) datasets, as well as the pumping rate, are used as the predictive variables in different lag times. To obtain the optimal input combinations, the Gamma Test (GT) is employed as a non-linear feature selection technique. The spatial analysis of the performance prediction is performed using several error metrics (e.g., R2, and NRMSE). Results indicate that the GBR provides a high prediction performance to predict the GWL, whereas the GRACE product is an accurate predictive variable. The correlation analysis between the predicted and observed GWL shows that the coefficient of determination values vary in the range of 0.66 to 0.94 over the different lead times. The spatial pattern of the prediction accuracy indicates that the regions with higher water depth and pumping rate offer higher performance. Moreover, the increasing trends in performance accuracy are observed from the north to south and the west to east of the Rafsanjan aquifer. In general, the proposed approach provides a reliable insight for water resources planner to make a decision based on the accurate modeling results.},

   abstract = {Modeling groundwater level (GWL) is a challenging task particularly in intensive groundwater-based irrigated regions due to its dependency on multiple natural and anthropogenic factors. The main motivation of the current investigation is to develop a new advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model for GWL simulation. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) optimized by Improved Alpha-Guided Grey Wolf optimization (IA-GWO) algorithm is proposed in this study for reliable prediction of GWL in an intensively irrigated region of Northwest Bangladesh. Natural and anthropogenic factors including rainfall, evapotranspiration, groundwater abstraction, and irrigation return flow were considered as input variables for the development of the models. The efficacy of the proposed model was compared with standalone ANFIS and ANN models and their hybrid versions using particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) models. Both standard statistical metrics and visual inspection of scatter plots, violin plots, and Taylor diagrams were employed for performance evaluation. Thirty-one years (1981–2011) monthly groundwater level data were used for the calibration and validation of the models. The results revealed the better performance of ANFIS-IA-GWO with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.06–0.11 and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.96–0.98 compared to ANFIS-PSO (NRMSE ∼ 0.38–0.55 and KGE ∼ 0.70–0.86) and ANN-IA-GWO (NRMSE ∼ 0.42–0.57 and KGE ∼ 0.75–0.91) and ANN-PSO (NRMSE ∼ 0.50–0.63 and KGE ∼ 0.63–0.83).

In past few decades, the urban groundwater resources declined significantly due to over exploitation, urbanization, population growth and climate change. To understand the role of these variables on groundwater level fluctuation, we developed a machine learning based modelling approach considering singular spectrum analysis (SSA), mutual information theory (MI), genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The developed approach was used to predict the groundwater levels in Bengaluru, a densely populated city with declining groundwater water resources. The input data which consist of groundwater levels, rainfall, temperature, NOI, SOI, NIÑO3 and monthly population growth rate were pre-processed using mutual information theory, genetic algorithm and lag analysis. Later, the optimized input sets were used in ANN and SVM to predict monthly groundwater level fluctuations. The results suggest that the machine learning based approach with data pre-processing predict groundwater levels accurately (R > 85%). It is also evident from the results that the pre-processing techniques enhance the prediction accuracy and results were improved for 66% of the monitored wells. Analysis of various input parameters suggest, inclusion of population growth rate is positively correlated with decrease in groundwater levels. The developed approach in this study for urban groundwater prediction can be useful particularly in cities where lack of pipeline/sewage/drainage lines leakage data hinders physical based modelling.},

Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.},

Monthly rainfall erosivity index (REI) composites for the first harmonic, covering 24-month ENSO events, are formed for all climate divisions over the United States spanning up to 29 ENSO episodes. From the harmonic vectorial maps plotted on the study area, each vector reveals both intensity and temporal phase of the ENSO-related REI teleconnection, and the corresponding candidate and core regions are determined using a machine learning technique of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based on magnitude and temporal phase of climate signal, and Köppen climate classification. As a result of vectorial mapping, five core regions were designated as the northwest (NW), the north central (NC), the northeast coastal (NEC), the southeast (SE), and the southwest/middle-inland (SWM) regions. During fall (0) to spring (+) seasons, the results of this analysis show negative (positive) rainfall erosivity response to the El Niño events at the NW and NC regions (NEC, SE, and SWM regions), while the opposite patterns are detected for the cold phase of ENSO. The temporal consistency values were 0.62 to 0.86 (0.73 to 0.82), and spatial coherence values ranged from 0.93 to 0.98 (0.94 to 0.97) for the El Niño (La Niña) events. Comparative analyses of rainfall erosivity responses to both warm and cold ENSO events reveal the high significance level of the ENSO-REI correlation with an opposite tendency in monthly rainfall erosivity anomalies. Above normal rainfall erosivity anomalies during the El Niño thermal forcing are more significant than below normal rainfall erosivity departures during the La Niña events. Consequently, middle latitude rainfall erosivity responses to the El Niño and La Niña phenomena are detectable over the contiguous United States.},

Human activity and related carbon emissions are the primary cause of land use and climate change, which has a substantial impact on extreme weather conditions, such as floods. This study presents high-resolution flood susceptibility maps of different future periods (up to 2100) using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS modelling. To quantify the future flood susceptibility various flood causative factors, Global circulation model (GCM) rainfall and land use and land cover (LULC) data are envisaged. The present flood susceptibility model has been evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, where area under curve (AUC) value shows the 91.57% accuracy of this flood susceptibility model and it can be used for future flood susceptibility modelling. Based on the projected LULC, rainfall and flood susceptibility, the results of the study indicating maximum monthly rainfall will increase by approximately 40–50 mm in 2100, while the conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural and built-up land is about 0.071 million sq. km. and the severe flood event area will increase by up to 122% (0.15 million sq. km) from now on.},

   abstract = {Water plans and operations (e.g., flood control, drought mitigation measures, water allocation, and engineering design) depend on reliable streamflow information. Thus, this study presents a methodology that improves streamflow forecasting using wavelet neural networks (WNN) for the short- (daily) and long-term (weekly, fortnightly, and monthly) in the Mahanadi River basin, India. The WNN model employs multilayer artificial neural networks (NN) to relate streamflows with wavelet-based approximations of previous streamflows and rainfalls. The methodology was validated using data from ten stations and three performance indices: Pearson correlation coefficient (R), percentage of trends (PBIAS), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). These indices confirmed that adding rainfall data as input provided better estimations than the sole use of streamflows. The WNN approach was superior to all other applications (NSE ranging from 0.299 to 0.987 for all time horizons and stations), especially for long-term forecasts in the Mahanadi River basin, and could be a viable alternative to other catchments.},

Four products are prominent in the literature, namely Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artiﬁcial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 Version 7 (3B42V7). The datasets from these products were compared statistically with the gauge observation dataset. Furthermore, the hydrologic performance of the products was evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model in two watersheds of the Lake Ziway basin. Four statistical and three contingency indices were used to compare the precipitation products statistically, and Nash-Sutcliﬀe eﬃciency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS) and the ratio of mean square error (RSR) were used to compare streamﬂow simulations. All the satellite-based precipitation products (CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CDR, and TRMM) performed well for monthly streamﬂow simulations for both watersheds. The reanalysis product CFSR performed the worst with high mean error (ME) and relative bias ratio (BIAS). The high ME and BIAS values of CFSR adversely aﬀected the hydrologic performance and resulted in unsatisfactory streamﬂow simulation. Performance of the CHIRPS precipitation product in capturing daily and monthly streamﬂows showed that it can provide valuable precipitation estimates for use as input in hydrologic models in data-sparse regions of developing countries such as Ethiopia.},

   abstract = {Satellite precipitation products are very useful as proxies for gauged observations, especially in Africa, where there are sparse in-situ precipitation-measuring weather stations. The two most commonly used satellite pre­ cipitation products in Africa (Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology Using Satellite and Ground-based Observations (TAMSAT)) and the relatively new Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM early run (IMERG-ER) of the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) with soil moisture (GPMþSM2RAIN) are evaluated in comparison to the in-situ observations from the Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory (TAHMO) project on daily, monthly and annual scales in West (Ghana) and East (Uganda) Africa. Statistical verification methods such as continuous and categorical methods were examined. For both countries, the results showed that all the products showed weak performance in capturing daily precipitation. For the monthly and seasonal scales, all the satellite product performances were very good. Also, small precipitation thresholds (2–5 mm/day) were relatively better detected by all the satellite products. All the products failed to detect intermediate (10–20 mm/day) and large threshold precipitation (>30 mm/day). When the products were examined for disaster management applications over a select number of stations in Ghana and Uganda, the results showed inconsistent and poor performances. Using all the metrics, both CHIRPS and TAMSAT showed similar performances, confirming that their common underlying algorithms are bias-adjusted, whereas GPMþSM2RAIN was different because of its independence from in-situ observations. All the products performed better in Ghana compared to Uganda, which may be due to the latter’s complex terrain. It is possible that CHIRPS and TAMSAT may be better suited for hydrological applications like seasonal fore­ casting, irrigation scheduling, reservoir operations than for daily or sub-daily processes like flash floods. While all these satellite products have their strengths and weaknesses for various environmental applications in Africa, there is a need for a central platform in Africa for a better or improved precipitation analysis based on the assimilation of climate forecasts, in-situ observations, radar, and satellite observations. This will provide higher temporal (3 hr–6 hr) and spatial (~2 km) resolutions. This study is applicable for scientists, water managers, and decision-makers involved in disaster risk management studies in Africa.},

   abstract = {Drought is an important natural disaster that causes devastating impacts on the ecosystem, livestock, environment, and society. So far, various remote-sensing methods have been developed to estimate drought conditions, each of which has advantages and restrictions. This study aims to monitor the real-time drought indices at the ﬁeld scales via the integration of various earth observations. Our proposed method consists of two steps. In the ﬁrst step, the relationships between long-term standardized precipitation indices (SPI) derived from PERSIANN-CDR rainfall data and two drought-dependent parameters derived from MODIS products, including normalized NDVI and soil-air temperature gradient, are obtained at the spatial resolution of PERSIANN-CDR grid (approximately 25 km). As the next step, the corresponding relationships are applied to estimate the drought index maps at the spatial resolution of MODIS products (1 km). Numerous analyses are carried out to evaluate the proposed method. The results revealed that, from various drought indices, including SPIs of diﬀerent timescales (1, 3, 6, and 12-months), SPI-3 and SPI-6 are more appropriate to the proposed method in terms of correlation with temperature and vegetation parameters. The ﬁndings also demonstrate the competency of the proposed method in estimating SPI indices with average RMSE 0.67 and the average correlation coeﬃcient of 0.74.},

Trends of both the datasets were also assessed using non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) and Modified MK (MMK) tests. CHIRPS (SPG) captured maximum precipitation in the range of 8.5–9.0 (8.0–8.5) mm/day in northeastern parts during the Monsoon season. CHIRPS slightly underestimated SPG in the range of −0.80 to −0.17 mm/day on area averaged pre­ cipitation of 46 stations for the period 1981–2018. Maximum ME, MAE, RMSE were observed as 2.0 mm/day, 1.8 mm/day and 1.8 mm/day respectively on annual timescale. Strong linear relationship (CC > 0.70) was noted between CHIRPS and SPG on monthly, Winter, Monsoon and Post-Monsoon season timescales. CHIRPS (SPG) showed increasing trends in 43 (26) stations using MK test and almost similar trend behavior was detected using MMK test on monthly timescale. CHIRPS showed increasing trends for all the six administrative regions for the period 1981–2018 using MK test and same trend behavior was observed using MMK test during the Monsoon season. Overall, good agreement between MK and MMK trend tests were observed with trivial variations in most of the administrative regions. Hence, it is concluded that CHIRPS can be a substitute of SPG in low and medium elevated and data scarce regions.},

   abstract = {Timely and accurate detection of drought events using reliable data with continuous spatial coverage is of great importance to adapt efficient mitigation strategies. Despite several studies that have been carried out to validate satellite precipitation products in Iran, the performance of satellite precipitation products in precipitation amount estimation and drought events detection has not been assessed yet simultaneously. It is unclear if good estimates of mean precipitation values by satellites can also provide good performance in detecting drought events. Here, we used a comprehensive framework to evaluate the accuracy of the satellite-based precipitation and their performance in detecting drought events against ground-based data. We evaluated three satellite precipitation products, namely, TRMM TMPA 3B43 v7, CHIRPS, and PERSIANN-CDR using multiple evaluation metrics, and three different drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Index-SPI, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index-SPEI, and Multivariate Standardized Precipitation Index-MSPI) over different climate zones of Iran during 1983–2017. Our results indicated that TRMM and PERSIANN-CDR had mainly over­ estimation while CHIRPS had mostly underestimation in precipitation over the different climates of Iran. The precipitation overestimation (underestimation) in TRMM, PERSIANN-CDR, and CHIRPS were observed in 80.0% (20.0%), 71.4% (28.6%), and 45.7% (54.3%) of stations, respectively. The most overestimation in satellite products was found to be in the arid-related climate regions, while the most underestimation was detected in humid-related climate regions. The average correlation coefficient values of PERSIANN-CDR (0.6) and TRMM (0.6) products against ground observations were higher than CHIRPS (0.4) dataset. Further, we found a lower correlation coefficient (0.3) between monthly satellite-based and ground-based precipitation in arid-related re­ gions (with Root Mean Square Error, RMSE, ~ 10 mm per month) of the country but a high correlation coef­ ficient (0.6) in humid-related climates (with RMSE ~100 mm per month). The results of the drought assessment indicated that the most severe meteorological drought events identified by SPI, SPEI, and MSPI were in 1998–2001, 2008–2009, 2010–2012, and 2016–2017 in all climate zones. The most intense drought events were in arid and semi-arid climate zones. Overall, in terms of the statistical metrics at multiple timescales, TRMM and PERSIANN-CDR outperformed CHIRPS, when compared against ground-based observations, for drought events detection. Also, TRMM and PERSIANN-CDR with higher scores for Probability of Detection (POD) and Critical Success Index (CSI) and lower scores for False Alarm Ratio (FAR) showed a good ability to detect drought events in arid and semi-arid climates compared to other climate zones. Although the CHIRPS estimated precipitation with acceptable accuracy, it did not detect drought events as the TRMM and PERSIANN-CDR did.},

   abstract = {Urban ﬂooding is a major issue worldwide, causing huge economic losses and serious threats to public safety. One promising way to mitigate its impacts is to develop a real-time ﬂood risk management system; however, building such a system is often challenging due to the lack of high spatiotemporal rainfall data. While some approaches (i.e., ground rainfall stations or radar and satellite techniques) are available to measure and/or predict rainfall intensity, it is difﬁcult to obtain accurate rainfall data with a desirable spatiotemporal resolution using these methods. This paper proposes an image-based deep learning model to estimate urban rainfall intensity with high spatial and temporal resolution. More speciﬁcally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model called the image-based rainfall CNN (irCNN) model is developed using rainfall images collected from existing dense sensors (i.e., smart phones or transportation cameras) and their corresponding measured rainfall intensity values. The trained irCNN model is subsequently employed to efﬁciently estimate rainfall intensity based on the sensors’ rainfall images. Synthetic rainfall data and real rainfall images are respectively utilized to explore the irCNN’s accuracy in theoretically and practically simulating rainfall intensity. The results show that the irCNN model provides rainfall estimates with a mean absolute percentage error ranging between 13.5% and 21.9%, which exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art modeling techniques in the literature. More importantly, the main feature of the proposed irCNN is its low cost in efﬁciently acquiring high spatiotemporal urban rainfall data. The irCNN model provides a promising alternative for estimating urban rainfall intensity, which can greatly facilitate the development of urban ﬂood risk management in a real-time manner.},

In Colombia, interannual climate variability can disrupt agricultural production, lower farmers' incomes and increase market prices. Increasing demand thus exists for agro-climatic services in the country. Fulﬁlling such demand requires robust and consistent approaches for seasonal climate forecasting. Here, we assess seasonal precipitation predictability and forecast skill at agriculturally-relevant timescales for ﬁve departments that represent key growing areas of major staple crops (rice, maize, and beans). Analyses use Canonical Correlation Analysis, with both observed SSTs and modeled (NCEP-CFSv2) SSTs, as well as with CFSv2 predicted precipitation ﬁelds (through a Model-Output-Statistics analysis). Some 74.4% of the forecast situations analyzed (5 departments ∗ 4 seasons ∗ 3 predictors ∗ 3 lead times) showed correlation-based goodness index (Kendall’s tau, − τ ) values above 0.1, 38.8% above 0.2, and 18.8% above 0.3. Predictability was limited towards eastern Colombia, and during wet periods of the year in the Inter-Andean Valleys. Importantly, results were consistent between ERSST and CFSv2-driven forecasts, implying that both can oﬀer valuable outlooks for Colombia. While our study is a ﬁrst important step toward the establishment of a sustainable and successful climate service for agriculture in Colombia, further work is required to (1) improve seasonal forecast skill; (2) link seasonal forecasts to agricultural modelling applications; (3) design appropriate delivery means; and (4) establish stakeholder-driven processes that allow two-way communication between forecast issuing institutions (e.g. IDEAM–Colombian Meteorological Service) and famers’ organizations and farming communities.},

   abstract = {With over 200,000 km2 of natural savannas, the Orinoquia region of Colombia is a key and strategic conservation area. Because of Colombia’s fast economic growth, there are signiﬁcant plans for agro-industrial expansion in the Orinoquia. This expansion may seriously affect water availability. To evaluate the cumulative impacts on freshwater ecosystems derived by different expansion scenarios, the use of a comprehensive framework for mathematical modeling, able to represent the hydrological processes at a macro-basin scale, is crucial for analysis and as a tool to bridge the gap between science and practice. In this work, we developed a general methodological framework for hydrological analysis at macro-basin scale consisting of four main stages: 1) collection and processing of hydro-climatological data, 2) characterization of hydro dependent water use sectors, 3) mathematical modeling and 4) scenario simulation. As a result of applying the proposed framework, we obtained a coupled hydrological model, which allows us to represent the rain-runoff process, the river-ﬂoodplain interaction and anthropic processes such as surface water extraction and groundwater extraction, enabling us to represent the complexity of the Orinoquia region. The model was successfully implemented in Matlab showing a Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency coefﬁcient between 0.62 and 0.92 in calibration and between 0.49 and 0.92 in validation. With this model we analyzed ﬁve different agroindustrial expansion scenarios, ﬁnding that the Colombian Orinoquia may have future high pressure on water resource areas with critical changes in the water availability regime. The scenarios show reductions of up to 85% in low water ﬂows in more than 50% of the area of the Colombian Orinoco basin. In the most extreme scenarios, the Meta, Vichada and Guaviare rivers show reductions of 95, 98 and 50% in low water ﬂows. The results show an urgent need to consider hydrology in planning processes to ensure the sustainability of this important area in Colombia.},

Macroeconomic indicators of the Amazonian departments in each of the different sectors were analyzed considering the added value exposed in the annual average of the Gross Domestic Product (2000–2012 in constant values) and contrasted with the sectoral demand for water and the growth projection, both of the human population and the growth trends of the economic activities. As a relevant result, it was found that the departments with a mining-energy tradition base their economic growth on the intensive use of water (greater pressure on the resource in m3/year). An average annual value of $374.42 million dollars is reported in water use (economic cost for the department of Putumayo alone) for oil extraction, which will increase in the future. This value has not been offset by the department, let alone taken into account in the economic growth indicators. It is concluded that the policy guidelines for water resource management in Colombia should be differentiated by sectors and by departments, considering the economic dynamics in the demand for water use and the heterogeneity of the populations.},

   abstract = {Prediction of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is of vital importance for Indian economy, and it has been remained a great challenge for hydro-meteorologists due to inherent complexities in the climatic systems. The Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns from tropical Paciﬁc Ocean (ENSO) and those from tropical Indian Ocean (EQUINOO) are established to inﬂuence the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall. The information of these two large scale atmospheric circulation patterns in terms of their indices is used to model the complex relationship between Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall and the ENSO as well as EQUINOO indices. However, extracting the signal from such large-scale indices for modeling such complex systems is signiﬁcantly difﬁcult. Rainfall predictions have been done for ‘All India’ as one unit, as well as for ﬁve ‘homogeneous monsoon regions of India’, deﬁned by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Recent ‘Artiﬁcial Intelligence’ tool ‘Genetic Programming’ (GP) has been employed for modeling such problem. The Genetic Programming approach is found to capture the complex relationship between the monthly Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall and large scale atmospheric circulation pattern indices – ENSO and EQUINOO. Research ﬁndings of this study indicate that GP-derived monthly rainfall forecasting models, that use large-scale atmospheric circulation information are successful in prediction of All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall with correlation coefﬁcient as good as 0.866, which may appears attractive for such a complex system. A separate analysis is carried out for All India Summer Monsoon rainfall for India as one unit, and ﬁve homogeneous monsoon regions, based on ENSO and EQUINOO indices of months of March, April and May only, performed at end of month of May. In this case, All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall could be predicted with 0.70 as correlation coefﬁcient with somewhat lesser Correlation Coefﬁcient (C.C.) values for different ‘homogeneous monsoon regions’.},

We analyze 20 years of Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) version 6 data and hydrometeorological disaster information from the National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure. The annual rainfall, the extreme rain index of R95p (number of very wet days), and R99p (number of very extremely wet days) show a slightly decreasing trend. However, the index of consecutive wet days (CWD) increases, resembling the rising number of floods and landslides. Rainfall shows robust seasonal and diurnal variations. Peak rainfall occurs in November–December and March–April, while the driest period is observed during August–October. Dry months associated with El-Nino, can cause severe dry conditions and increase the potential for catastrophic forest fires. The peak precipitation amount and frequency were observed in the early morning and the second peak in the afternoon. Mainland areas tend to have a peak occurring later than those on the coast and ocean. The results of this study can be additional information in formulating a strategic plan to anticipate future hydrometeorological disasters in IKN.},

We introduce the self-attention mechanism and the long-term memory state into the model and design a new set of gating mechanisms.

We further train the model using a combination of reverse scheduled sampling and scheduled sampling to learn the long-term dynamics from the radar echo sequences. Experimental results show that the new model (ISA-PredRNN) can effectively extract the spatiotemporal features of radar echo maps and obtain radar echo prediction results with a small gap from the ground truths. From the comparison with the other six models, the new ISA-PredRNN model has the most accurate prediction results with a critical success index (CSI) of 0.7001, 0.5812 and 0.3052 under the radar echo thresholds of 10 dBZ, 20 dBZ and 30 dBZ, respectively.},

Rainfall is the most significant climate element affecting the livelihood and well-being of the majority of Ethiopians. Rainfall variability has a great impact on agricultural production, water supply, transportation, the environment, and urban planning. Because all agricultural activities and subsequent national crop production hinge on the amount and distribution of rainfall, accurate monthly and seasonal predictions of this rainfall are vital for agricultural planning. Rainfall prediction is also useful for governmental, non-governmental, and private agencies in making long-term decisions and planning in numerous areas such as farming, early warning of potential hazards, drought mitigation, disaster prevention, and insurance policy. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used in almost every area, and rainfall prediction is one of them. In this study, we attempt to investigate the use of AI-based models to predict monthly rainfall at 92 Ethiopian meteorological stations. The applicability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models in predicting long-term monthly precipitation was investigated using geographical and periodicity component (longitude, latitude, and altitude) data collected from 2011 to 2021. The experimental results reveal that the ANFIS model outperforms the ANN model in all assessment criteria across all testing stations. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients were 0.995 for ANFIS and 0.935 for ANN over testing stations.},

This paper compares the performances of three machine and deep learning-based rainfall forecasting approaches including a hybrid optimized-by-PSO support vector regression (PSO-SVR), long-short term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The approaches are used to develop both 5-minute and 15–minute ahead forecast models of rainfall depth based on datasets of Niavaran station, Tehran, Iran. Results of applying the models to all data points indicated that PSO-SVR and LSTM approaches performed almost the same and better than CNN. Subse­ quently, rainfall events were divided into four classes depending on their severity and duration using K-nearest neighbor method, and a separate forecast model was built for each of the classes. Classification of the events improved the forecast models accuracy where PSO-SVR and LSTM were the best approaches for the 15-minute and 5-minute ahead rainfall forecast models, respectively. Investigating the impact of more predictors on the forecast quality, adding differences of rainfall depths to model predictors improved the accuracy of PSO-SVR approach for the 5-minute ahead forecast model up to 13%. Furthermore, depending on the rainfall event, additional input variables considering rainfall depth fluctuations over shorter time periods than the forecast lead time increased the performances of the PSO-SVR and LSTM approaches between 3–15% and 2–10%, respectively.},

In the Southwest US, droughts are associated with severe deficits in soil moisture and streamflow, which can adversely affect ecosystems in the region. Meanwhile, droughts are expected to have severe impacts on water supply and agriculture in the Southeast US due to increasing water demand, limited storage capacity, and predominantly rainfed agriculture in the region.

Understanding the key information in the spatial and temporal domain is essential to make accurate forecasts. The capabilities of deep learning methods can be applied in such instances due to their enhanced ability in learning complex relationships. Given its success in other domains, this study presents a framework that features a long short-term memory deep learning model for spatio temporal hydrological extreme forecasting in the South Pacific region. The data consists of satellite rainfall estimates and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. We use the satellite rainfall estimate to calculate the effective drought index (EDI), an indicator of hydrological extreme events. The framework is developed to forecast monthly EDI using three different approaches: (i) univariate (ii) multivariate with neighbouring spatial points (iii) multivariate with neighbouring spatial points and the eigenvector values of SST. Additionally, better identification of extreme wet events is noted with the inclusion of the eigenvector values of SST. By establishing the framework for the multivariate approach in two forms, it is evident that the model accuracy is contingent on understanding the dominant feature which influences precipitation regimes in the Pacific. The framework can be used to better understand linear and non-linear relationships within multi-dimensional data in other study regions, and provide long-term climate outlooks.},

Rainfall nowcasting with strong timeliness needs to effectively forecast the intensity of rainfall in a local region in the short term. The forecast performance of traditional methods is limited. In this paper, a rainfall nowcasting model based on the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) is proposed. Combined reﬂectance (CR) and the retrieved wind ﬁeld are selected as the key factors for prediction. The model considers the inﬂuence of water vapor content, transport, and change on rainfall by measuring CR and the retrieved wind ﬁeld. Forecast results are compared to different models and different input data schemes. The analysis shows that the CSI scores of this method can reach about 0.8, which is 28% higher than that of the optical ﬂow method. The ConvLSTM structure with spatial analysis and time memory can greatly enhance the predictive ability of the model, and the addition of wind ﬁeld data also improves the forecasting performance of the model. Therefore, the idea of forecasting rainfall on the basis of water vapor content and water vapor transport is practical and effective, and the accuracy of a forecast can be improved by using ConvLSTM network to extract spatiotemporal features.},

The methodology was developed using six years of historical-geographical data from three different substations in Kashmir, with four explanatory independent variables: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity measured at 12 am., and humidity measured at 3 pm., as well as a target variable indicating the amount of rainfall. For better computational time and performance accuracy, the proposed algorithm is trained using the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithms. The grey wolf levenberg-marquardt (GWLM) and NARX implementation methodology was deemed one of the best-fit models, with mean squared error (MSE) and regression value (R) predictions of 3.12 percent and 0.9899 percent in training, 0.144 percent and 0.9936 percent in validation, and 0.311 percent and 0.9988 percent in testing. The suggested model was then compared to a number of traditional and ensemble machine learning (ML) methods, and it was determined that the proposed model performs better with less processing time, making the grey wolf levenberg marquardt nonlinear auto regression with external inputs (GWLM-NARX) model a more practical neural network model to use.},

   abstract = {Probabilistic seasonal rainfall forecasting is of great importance for stakeholders such as farmers and policymakers to assist in developing risk management strategies and to inform decisions. In practice, there are two kinds of commonly used tools, dynamical models and statistical models, to provide probabilistic seasonal rainfall forecasts. Dynamical models are based on physical processes but are usually expensive to operate and implement, and rely overly on initial conditions. Statistical models are easy to implement but are usually based on simple or linear relationships between observed variables. Recently, machine learning techniques have been widely used in climate projection and perform well in reproducing historical climate. For these reasons, we conducted a case study in Australia by developing a machine learning-based probabilistic seasonal rainfall forecasting model using multiple large-scale climate indices from the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans. Rainfall probabilities of exceeding the climatological median for upcoming seasons from 2011 to 2018 were successively forecasted using multiple climate indices of precedent six months. The performance of the model was evaluated by comparing it with an officially used forecasting model, the SOI (Southern Oscillation Index) phase model (SP) operated by Queensland government in Australia. Results indicated that the random forest (RF) model outperformed the SP model in terms of both distinct forecasts and forecasting accuracy. The RF model increased the percentages of distinct forecasts to 64.9% for spring, to 71.5% for summer, to 65.8% for autumn, and to 63.9% for winter, 1.4 ~ 3.2 times of the values from the SP model. Forecasting accuracy was also greatly increased by 28%, 167%, 219%, and 76% for four seasons respectively, compared to the SP model. The proposed rainfall forecasting model is based on readily available data, and we believe it can be easily extended to other regions to provide seasonal rainfall outlooks.},

   abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) is an effective technique for dealing with complex systems. This study proposes a hybrid DL approach, a combination of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) (hereinafter referred to as hybrid Conv1D-MLP model), for multi-stepahead (1-day to 5-day in advance) daily rainfall prediction. Nine meteorological variables, closely associated with daily rainfall variation, are used as inputs to the hybrid model. The causal variables are obtained from a General Circulation Model (GCM). In general, simulation of meteorological variables from GCM is much better than rainfall estimate and observed records of meteorological variables is sparsely available, if not completely unavailable at many locations. Thus, proposed scheme helps to establish the effectiveness of the DL approach in augmenting the quality of rainfall prediction, exploiting the potential of GCM in simulating meteorological variables. The developed hybrid model is applied to twelve different locations in different climatic regimes in terms of daily precipitation characteristics. The proposed hybrid approach is compared with a DL approach namely, Multi-Layered Perceptron (deep MLP) and another machine learning approach namely, Support Vector Regression (SVR). It is also found that the performance of the model gradually decreases as the prediction lead time (in days) increases. Overall, this study establishes the fact that the hybrid Conv1D-MLP model is more effective in capturing the complex relationship between the causal variables and daily variation of rainfall. The beneﬁt is due to the uniﬁcation of potentials of individual approaches for extracting the hidden features of hydrometeorological association.},

As deterministic weather forecasting models are usually time consuming, it becomes challenging to efficiently use this large volume of data in hand. Machine learning methods are already proven to be good replacement for traditional deterministic approaches in weather prediction. This paper presents an approach using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) techniques to improve the rainfall forecast performance. This will be compared with the random forest classifier and XGBoost as well. The goal is to predict a set of hourly rainfall levels from sequences of weather radar measurements. Python libraries are utilized to forecast the time series data. The training set comprises of data from first 20 days of every month and the inference set data from the continuing days. This makes sure that both train and inference sets are more or less independent. The idea resides in implementing an end-to-end learning framework.},

In recent years, modeling meteorological data with deep neural networks has become a relevant area of investigation. These works apply either recurrent neural networks (RNN) or some hybrid approach mixing RNN and convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this work, we propose STConvS2S (Spatiotemporal Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Network), a deep learning architecture built for learning both spatial and temporal data dependencies using only convolutional layers. Our proposed architecture resolves two limitations of convolutional networks to predict sequences using historical data: (1) they violate the temporal order during the learning process and (2) they require the lengths of the input and output sequences to be equal. Computational experiments using air temperature and rainfall data from South America show that our architecture captures spatiotemporal context and that it outperforms or matches the results of stateof-the-art architectures for forecasting tasks. In particular, one of the variants of our proposed architecture is 23% better at predicting future sequences and ﬁve times faster at training than the RNN-based model used as a baseline.},

   abstract = {Advance prediction of heavy rainfall days over a given location is of paramount importance as heavy rainfall impacts ecosystems, leads to floods, accounts largely for the total rainfall over the region and its prediction is highly desired for the efficient management of weather-dependent activities. Traditionally, Numerical Weather Prediction models serve the purpose of weather predictions, but they have their constraints and limitations. In this regard, artificial intelligence and machine learning tools have gained popularity in recent years. In the present study, we have employed the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, one of the machine learning methods, on a long time-series rainfall data for the determination of heavy and light rainfall days. Climatological data of daily rainfall for a period of 116 years from 1901 to 2016 over Sriharikota (13.66 degrees N, 80.23 degrees E), a coastal island location in India, is used for training the GPR model for the identification of the heavy and light category of rainy days. The performance of the GPR model is investigated by predicting the heavy and light rainfall days per year over Sriharikota. K-nearest neighbour, random forest, and decision tree models are also used and results are compared. The validation of GPR results shows that the performance of the proposed model is satisfying (root mean square error = 0.161; mean absolute error = 0.126; mean squared error = 0.026), especially for the heavy rainfall days. Furthermore, GPR model is extended to prediction of spatial distribution of monthly rainfall over the Indian region. Results obtained from the present study encourages the utilization of the GPR model as one of the promising machine learning tools for the prediction of heavy rainfall days over a given location.},

   abstract = {The scarcity of site-scale actual evapotranspiration (ET) measurements poses a challenge for modelling and verifying regional ET. Taking the grassland ecosystem in arid and semi-arid regions of Northern China (ASNC) as an example, we proposed a framework for estimating ET at weather stations without flux observations through a machine learning approach by combining data from MODIS and fifteen flux towers distributed in alpine grassland (AG) and temperate grassland (TG) across ASNC. First, we analyzed the temporal characteristics of grassland ET at site scale. Second, we applied the machine learning approach Random Forest (RF) to develop a robust model for simulating site-scale grassland ET, and used random and spatial cross-validations (CVs) and three metrics to evaluate the RF models performance. Two strategies (using pooled data from all flux towers for a general model, and dividing data by grassland type to develop models specific to AG and TG) and four temporal resolutions (daily, 8-day, monthly and seasonal) were used to develop the RF models. Third, we investigated how the importance of predictor variables for estimating grassland ET changed in different CVs, strategies and temporal resolutions. The ET of AG and TG showed similar dynamic patterns but differed in magnitude. The RF models showed good performance in both strategies and all four temporal resolutions (R-2 > 0.64, MAE < 0.53 mm d(-1), RMSE < 0.72 mm d(-1)). However, seasonal ET simulations performed better than that of daily, 8-day and monthly using pooled data from all flux towers, especially in spatial CV. Meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and radiation), vegetation (NDVI, LAI and FPAR) and soil (soil water content and soil temperature) were strong predictors of variation in grassland ET. Changes in the importance ranking and value of predictor variables partly explained the variations of model performance. The robust model performance in spatial CV proved that the framework developed in this study was reliable when applied to weather stations without flux observations, thereby overcoming the scarcity of site-scale actual ET measurements.},

   abstract = {In water bodies, sediment transport is a potential source of numerous negative effects on water resource projects and can damage environmental services. Two machine learning (ML) algorithms, the M5P and random forest (RF) models, have been explored for the first time as alternatives to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to estimate suspended sediment load (SSL) in the Oskotz river basin, a forested experimental basin in Navarra, northern Spain. In the ML models, streamflow and precipitation data were used to estimate daily SSL, testing different combinations of these inputs. The ML models were more accurate than the physically based hydrological SWAT model for all input scenarios tested at the daily scale. Moreover, although the SWAT results improved considerably at the monthly scale, the statistics obtained were generally inferior compared to the ML models. For the best combination of inputs, M5P demonstrated a superior ability to estimate SSL (R2 = 0.73, MAE = 135.04, RSR = 0.54, NSE = 0.71 and PBIAS = 5.19), compared to RF (R2 = 0.72, MAE = 143.39, RSR = 0.57, NSE = 0.67 and PBIAS = 11.60) and SWAT (R2 = 0.57, MAE = 181.24, RSR = 0.65, NSE = 0.57 and PBIAS = -1.27). The average sediment loads in winter, the season with the highest sediment generation in the Oskotz basin, were 2,094.04, 1,831.08 and 2,242.67 tonnes for M5P, RF and SWAT, respectively, compared to an observed SSL of 1,878.16 tonnes. These results indicate that M5P and RF are suitable models for simulating fluvial sediment production since they improved the results of the SWAT model, which also requires more time and data to set up and calibrate. However, since SWAT does not require observed streamflow as an input, it remains a useful model, achieving acceptable results in basins with limited streamflow data.},

   abstract = {The rapid acceleration of the global water cycle caused by changes in global climate trigger complex processes that make conventional machine learning techniques limited in assessing impacts of such changes on terrestrial water storage (TWS). This study introduces an assimilated deep learning neural network to improve the modeling of TWS dynamics. Key predictors and inputs to this deep learning framework include runoff, rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, global teleconnection patterns and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The proposed back propagation model in this study capitalizes on the availability of remotely sensed observations and model datasets to predict monthly TWS, a quantity that is difficult to observe in the field, but important for the estimation of regional water budget balance, and water resource management for agricultural purposes. By integrating pre-processed outputs from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) into our network using a deep neural pattern, we synthesized TWS from 2002 to 2017, and also made future predictions using our trained models. Results from these analyses showed that the ICA-BPNN model has a higher predictive accuracy compared to the PCA-BPNN. These models (ICA-BPNN and PCA-BPNN) were used to fit the three dominant temporal patterns of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) – observed TWS over Africa. Our simulation results from the testing phase indicate that the fits for the prediction of the first three leading modes of TWS for both models when compared to the observed GRACE-TWS were PCA-BPNN1 (89%), PCA-BPNN2 (82%), PCA-BPNN3 (84%) and ICA-BPNN1 (93%), ICA-BPNN2 (88%), ICA-BPNN3 (82%). The simulation fit of the BPNN corresponding to multi-annual time series, which are captured in the second and third orthogonal modes and localized patterns of TWS were lower than those of annual signals in both the PCA- and ICA-BPNN models. This was attributed to the fact that the multi-annual time series in GRACE-hydrological signals of our test-bed are complex compared to the annual patterns of TWS. On the one hand, this exemplifies the superior performance of our predictive framework in modeling naturalized system (annual changes in TWS driven by only climatic factors). On the other hand, the complexity in modelling multi-annual variations in TWS suggests heavily disturbed naturalized systems evidenced in the presence of human water management operations among other anthropogenic activities.},

To improve the SSS retrieval from SMAP data, we developed a robust algorithm based on a machine-learning approach with high-resolution in-situ data from the Ocean Moored Buoy Network in the Northern Indian Ocean (OMNI), which includes the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB). The new algorithm was rigorously trained, tested and validated using the in-situ SSS time series measurements from the AS and BoB. Several sensitive variables were examined and used to improve the SSS estimates - such as radiometric and ancillary data from the satellite observations, sea-surface wind and precipitation from the ERA5 data, and SSS/ SST from the OMNI buoy measurements. The OMNI time-series measurements provided the spatially averaged satellite products to characterize the variability and gross features of SSS in BoB and AS waters on weekly, monthly, seasonal and annual time scales. The systematic validation of SMAP SSS products on a range of spatio-temporal scales showed that the new algorithm improved the SSS estimates by more than 15% in open ocean waters and 25% in river-discharge and precipitation-dominated regions in BoB and AS, when compared to the standard (operational) algorithm. Further analysis demonstrated that the new algorithm reduced clear biases and significant anomalies in SMAP SSS retrievals in the regions of river runoff, surface-freshened ocean and intense tropical cyclones, and captured synoptic/mesoscale SSS features and their seasonal variations in the North Indian Ocean.},

Understanding the performance of SPPs is essential before their application in estimating multiple processes. This paper evaluated the accuracy and error composition of GPM IMERG Final-run V06 and TRMM 3B42V7 in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) based on the China Gauge-based Daily Precipitation Analysis dataset (CGDPA) during 2001–2019. Afterwards, the precipitation correction by merging satellite and gauge observation precipitation was conducted with three Tree-based Machine Learning models, Decision Tree (DT), Adaptive Boosting Decision Trees (Adaboost), and Random Forest (RF). The results show that: (1) Two SPPs can well reflect the spatial pattern and in-year variation of precipitation in the TGRA. However, they are limited in estimating precipitation amount for seriously underestimated the light rain or overestimated torrential rain. Under the influence of climate and variety terrains, the SPPs accuracy in the middle-elevation relief mountains of downstream is significantly higher than that in the low-elevation relief mountains of upstream. Moreover, that on the monthly and annual scales are higher than on the daily scale. Comparing two SPPs, the area proportions of IMERG-F better than 3B42V7 are 64.0%, 86.0%, and 81.6% on daily, monthly and annual scales, respectively. (2) Both the systematic error components of two SPPs raise with the increase of precipitation amount, and the error spatial pattern of 3B42V7 is more affected by precipitation. The random error component of light rain and daily precipitation is higher than other grades and scales. Despite this, the random error component decreases significantly when daily precipitation is accumulated. (3) The three primary factors affecting error correction of SPPs are precipitation amount, longitude, and DEM in TGRA. Among the three Tree-based methods, the RF showed the best error correction effect, and it can significantly improve the monthly and annual precipitation accuracy and better reproduce probability density function (PDF). Cumulative precipitation can reduce the random error component of daily precipitation and have high correction accuracy when cumulative time exceeds 5-days.},

Also, the multivariate polynomial regression of second order (MPR-2) model performed best for February and March rainfalls.

Although the situation continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand what factors may be driving transmission through different populations, both for potential future waves, as well as the implications for future pandemics. In this report, we compiled a database of more than 28 potentially explanatory variables for each of the 50 U.S. states through early May 2020. Using a combination of traditional statistical and modern machine learning approaches, we identified those variables that were the most statistically significant, and, those that were the most important. These variables were chosen to be fiduciaries of a range of possible drivers for COVID-19 deaths in the USA. We found that population-weighted population density (PWPD), some “stay at home” metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation, race/ethnicity, and chronic low-respiratory death rate, were all statistically significant. Of these, PWPD and mobility metrics dominated. This suggests that the biggest impact on COVID-19 deaths was, at least initially, a function of where you lived, and not what you did. However, clearly, increasing social distancing has the net effect of (at least temporarily) reducing the effective PWPD. Our results strongly support the idea that the loosening of “lock-down” orders should be tailored to the local PWPD. In contrast to these variables, while still statistically significant, race/ethnicity, health, and climate effects could only account for a few percent of the variability in deaths. Where associations were anticipated but were not found, we discuss how limitations in the parameters chosen may mask a contribution that might otherwise be present.},

In comparison, Maxent showed the maximum region under habitat suitability criteria (1884.48 km2), followed by Random Forest (70.73 km2) and Bioclim (11.62 km2) model. Except for the Maxent model, suitable habitats predicted by other models are highly restricted within and across the study species' current distribution range. The average model prediction shows an expanded distribution range for the species up to Tawang which is the closest district of currently known distribution of the species in the state. Thus, the present study recognizes the importance of the geographic range of G. assamicus, a critically endangered species with very limited spatial distribution range and also provides some specific details to explore possible habitats for the species in new areas of potential occurrence in Arunachal Pradesh, India.},

For the planning and the management of water resources, this is very essential to generate a soft computing method that can predict or forecast groundwater table (GWT). The different machine and deep learning algorithms are evaluated in this research work to predict the groundwater table using season, monthly rainfall, and evapotranspiration rate, which are further compared. The performance evaluation of the different algorithms was done using five different statistical parameters, i.e., mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), R2−score, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). From the results of this study, it is concluded that the Multivariate polynomial regression algorithm is the most efficient for predicting the groundwater table with the minimum mean absolute error in the range of 0.63–0.85 and R2-score of 0.82–0.88.},

   abstract = {Retention ponds provide benefits including flood control, groundwater recharge, and water quality improvement, but changes in weather conditions could limit the effectiveness in improving microbial water quality metrics. The concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), which is used as regulatory standards to assess microbial water quality in retention ponds, could vary widely based on many factors including local weather and influent water chemistry and composition. In this critical review, we analyzed 7421 data collected from 19 retention ponds across North America listed in the International Stormwater BMP Database to examine if variable FIB removal in the field conditions can be predicted based on changes in these weather and water composition factors. Our analysis confirms that FIB removal in retention ponds is sensitive to weather conditions or seasons, but temperature and precipitation data may not describe the variable FIB removal. These weather conditions affect suspended solid and nutrient concentrations, which in turn could affect FIB concentration in the ponds. Removal of total suspended solids and total P only explained 5% and 12% of FIB removal data, respectively, and TN removal had no correlation with FIB removal. These results indicate that regression-based modeling with a single parameter as input has limited use to predict FIB removal due to the interactive nature of their effects on FIB removal. In contrast, machine learning algorithms such as the random forest method were able to predict 65% of the data. The overall analysis indicates that the machine learning model could play a critical role in predicting microbial water quality of surface waters under complex conditions where the variation of both water composition and weather conditions could deem regression-based modeling less effective.},

   abstract = {In actual engineering fields, the bearing capacity of a rock is closely related to the pore water pressure in the rock. Studies have shown that the pore water in the rock has a great relationship with the change in runoff. Thus, it has crucial meaning to accurately evaluate and quantitate the property of the rainfall-runoff, and many traditional classic models are proposed to study the characteristic of rainfall-runoff. While considering the high uncertainty and randomness of the rainfall-runoff property, more and more artificial neural networks (ANN) are used for the rainfall-runoff modeling as well as other fields. Among them, the long short-term memory (LSTM), which can be trained for sequence generation by processing real data sequences one step at a time and has good prediction results in other engineering fields, is adopted in this study to investigate the changes of rainfall-runoff values and make a prediction. In order to ensure the accuracy of the trained model, the cross-validation method is used in this study. The training data set is divided into 12 parts. The monthly forecast results from 2014 to 2015 show that the model can well reflect the peaks and troughs. In a recent study, the relationship between the rainfall-runoff and discharge are commonly based on the current measured data, while the prediction results are adopted to analyze the relation of these parameters, and considering that the existing methods have fuzzy relationship between runoff and discharge, which leads to a high risk of forecasting and dispatching. A method of modeling analysis and parameter estimation of hydrological runoff and discharge relationship based on machine learning is designed. From the experimental results, the average risk of this method is 61.23%, which is 15.104% and 13.397% less than that of the other two existing methods, respectively. It proves that the method of hydrological runoff relationship modeling and parameter estimation integrated with machine learning has better practical application effect.},

In this work, a recent state-of-the-art architecture has been adapted and deployed for multivariate input time series forecasting (transformers) using past values of ET0 and temperature-based parameters (28 input configurations) to forecast daily ET0 up to a week (1 to 7 days). Additionally, it has been compared to standard machine learning models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and two baselines (historical monthly mean value and a moving average of the previous seven days) in five locations with different geo-climatic characteristics in the Andalusian region, Southern Spain. In general, machine learning models significantly outperformed the baselines. Furthermore, the accuracy dramatically dropped when forecasting ET0 for any horizon longer than three days. SVM, ELM, and RF using configurations I, III, IV, and IX outperformed, on average, the rest of the configurations in most cases. The best NSE values ranged from 0.934 in Cordoba to 0.869 in Tabernas, using SVM. The best RMSE, on average, ranged from 0.704 mm/day for Malaga to 0.883 mm/day for Conil using RF. In terms of MBE, most models and cases performed very accurately, with a total average performance of 0.011 mm/day. We found a relationship in performance regarding the aridity index and the distance to the sea. The higher the aridity index at inland locations, the better results were obtained in forecasts. On the other hand, for coastal sites, the higher the aridity index, the higher the error. Due to the good performance and the availability as an open-source repository of these models, they can be used to accurately forecast ET0 in different geo-climatic conditions, helping to increase efficiency in tasks of great agronomic importance, especially in areas with low rainfall or where water resources are limiting for the development of crops.},

For this purpose, firstly ETo data were estimated using meteorological data and the FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) method. Then, ETo modeling by six machine learning techniques including multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), model tree M5 (M5), random forest (RF) and least-squares boost (LSBoost) was carried out. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used under seven scenarios to rank models with evaluation and time criteria in the next step. After proving the acceptable performance of the LSBoost model, the downscaling of temperature (T) and precipitation (P) by the delta change factor (CF) method under three models ACCESS-ESM1-5, CanESM5 and MRI-ESM2-0 (scenarios SSP245-cov-fossil (SCF), SSP245-cov-modgreen (SCM) and SSP245-cov-strgreen (SCS)) was performed. The results showed that the monthly changes in the average T increases at all stations for all scenarios. Also, the average monthly change ratio of P increases in most stations and scenarios. In the next step, ETo forecasting under climate change for periods (2021-2050) was performed using the best model. Prediction results showed that ETo increases in all scenarios and stations in a pessimistic and optimistic state. In addition, the Monte Carlo method (MCM) showed that the lowest uncertainty is related to the Mianeh station in the MRI-ESM2-0 model and SCS scenario.},

The Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) is one of the highest basins in the world and has a wide variety of vegetation types because of its complex topographic and climatic conditions. In this paper, the sensitivity to climate change for different vegetation types, as reflected by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), was assessed in the YZRB. Three machine learning models, including multiple linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were adopted to simulate the response of each vegetation type to climatic variables. We selected random forest, which showed the highest performance in both the calibration and validation periods, to assess the sensitivity of the NDVI to temperature and precipitation changes on an annual and monthly scale using hypothetical climatic scenarios. The results indicated there were positive responses of the NDVI to temperature and precipitation changes, and the NDVI was more sensitive to temperature than to precipitation on an annual scale. The NDVI was predicted to increase by 1.60-4.68% when the temperature increased by 1.5 degrees C, while it only changed by 0.06-0.24% when the precipitation increased by 10% in the YZRB. Monthly, the vegetation was more sensitive to temperature changes in spring and summer. Spatially, the vegetation was more sensitive to temperature increases in the upper and middle reaches, where the existing temperatures were cooler. The time-lag effects of climate were also analyzed in detail. For both temperature and precipitation, Needleleaf Forest and Broadleaf Forest had longer time lags than those of other vegetation types. These findings are useful for understanding the eco-hydrological processes of the Tibetan Plateau.},

Hence, robust and accurate rainfall forecasting models need to be created by applying various machine learning and deep learning approaches. Several automatic systems were created to predict the weather, but it depends on the type of weather pattern, season and location, which leads in maximizing the processing time. Therefore, in this work, significant artificial algae long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning network is introduced to forecast the monthly rainfall. During this process, Homogeneous Indian Monthly Rainfall Data Set (1871-2016) is utilized to collect the rainfall information. The gathered information is computed with the help of an LSTM approach, which is able to process the time series data and predict the dependency between the data effectively. The most challenging phase of LSTM training process is finding optimal network parameters such as weight and bias. For obtaining the optimal parameters, one of the Meta heuristic bio-inspired algorithms called Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) is used. The forecasted rainfall for the testing dataset is compared with the existing models. The forecasted results exhibit superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art models for forecasting Indian Monsoon rainfall.

   abstract = {Gridded monthly rainfall estimates can be used for a number of research applications, including hydrologic modeling and weather forecasting. Automated interpolation algorithms, such as the “autoKrige” function in R, can produce gridded rainfall estimates that validate well but produce unrealistic spatial patterns. In this work, an optimized geostatistical kriging approach is used to interpolate relative rainfall anomalies, which are then combined with long-term means to develop the gridded estimates. The optimization consists of the following: 1) determining the most appropriate offset (constant) to use when log-transforming data; 2) eliminating poor quality data prior to interpolation; 3) detecting erroneous maps using a machine learning algorithm; and 4) selecting the most appropriate parameterization scheme for fitting the model used in the interpolation. Results of this effort include a 30-yr (1990-2019), highresolution (250-m) gridded monthly rainfall time series for the state of Hawai'i. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) is performed using an extensive network of 622 observation stations. LOOCV results are in good agreement with observations (R-2 = 0.78; MAE = 55 mm month(-1); -1%); however, predictions can underestimate high rainfall observations (bias = 34 mm month(-1); -1%) due to a well-known smoothing effect that occurs with kriging. This research highlights the fact that validation statistics should not be the sole source of error assessment and that default parameterizations for automated interpolation may need to be modified to produce realistic gridded rainfall surfaces. Data products can be accessed through the Hawai`i Data Climate Portal (HCDP; http://www.hawaii.edu/climate-data-portal).},

Two machine learning (ML) algorithms, the M5P and random forest (RF) models, have been explored for the first time as alternatives to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to estimate suspended sediment load (SSL) in the Oskotz river basin, a forested experimental basin in Navarra, northern Spain. In the ML models, streamflow and precipitation data were used to estimate daily SSL, testing different combinations of these inputs. The ML models were more accurate than the physically based hydrological SWAT model for all input scenarios tested at the daily scale. Moreover, although the SWAT results improved considerably at the monthly scale, the statistics obtained were generally inferior compared to the ML models. For the best combination of inputs, M5P demonstrated a superior ability to estimate SSL (R2 = 0.73, MAE = 135.04, RSR = 0.54, NSE = 0.71 and PBIAS = 5.19), compared to RF (R2 = 0.72, MAE = 143.39, RSR = 0.57, NSE = 0.67 and PBIAS = 11.60) and SWAT (R2 = 0.57, MAE =181.24, RSR = 0.65, NSE = 0.57 and PBIAS =-1.27). The average sediment loads in winter, the season with the highest sediment generation in the Oskotz basin, were 2,094.04, 1,831.08 and 2,242.67 tonnes for M5P, RF and SWAT, respectively, compared to an observed SSL of 1,878.16 tonnes. These results indicate that M5P and RF are suitable models for simulating fluvial sediment production since they improved the results of the SWAT model, which also requires more time and data to set up and calibrate. However, since SWAT does not require observed streamflow as an input, it remains a useful model, achieving acceptable results in basins with limited streamflow data.},

Afterwards, the precipitation correction by merging satellite and gauge observation precipitation was conducted with three Tree-based Machine Learning models, Decision Tree (DT), Adaptive Boosting Decision Trees (Adaboost), and Random Forest (RF). The results show that: (1) Two SPPs can well reflect the spatial pattern and in-year variation of precipitation in the TGRA. However, they are limited in estimating precipitation amount for seriously underestimated the light rain or overestimated torrential rain. Under the influence of climate and variety terrains, the SPPs accuracy in the middle-elevation relief mountains of downstream is significantly higher than that in the low-elevation relief mountains of upstream. Moreover, that on the monthly and annual scales are higher than on the daily scale. Comparing two SPPs, the area proportions of IMERG-F better than 3B42V7 are 64.0%, 86.0%, and 81.6% on daily, monthly and annual scales, respectively. (2) Both the systematic error components of two SPPs raise with the increase of precipitation amount, and the error spatial pattern of 3B42V7 is more affected by precipitation. The random error component of light rain and daily precipitation is higher than other grades and scales. Despite this, the random error component decreases significantly when daily precipitation is accumulated. (3) The three primary factors affecting error correction of SPPs are precipitation amount, longitude, and DEM in TGRA. Among the three Tree-based methods, the RF showed the best error correction effect, and it can significantly improve the monthly and annual precipitation accuracy and better reproduce probability density function (PDF). Cumulative precipitation can reduce the random error component of daily precipitation and have high correction accuracy when cumulative time exceeds 5-days.},

Globally, numerous efforts have been made to anticipate potential droughts, crop conditions, and food shortages in order to improve early warning and risk management for food insecurity. To support this goal, we develop an Earth Observation (EO) and machine-learning-based operational, subnational maize yield forecast system and evaluate its out-of-sample forecast skills during the growing seasons for Kenya, Somalia, Malawi, and Burkina Faso. In general, forecast skills improve substantially during the vegetative growth period (VP) and gradually during the reproductive development period (RP). Thus, mid-season assessment can provide effective early warning months before harvest. Skillful forecasts (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) < 20%) appear approximately two dekads after the VP; for example, skillful forecasts appear in May in Kenya and Somalia, January in Malawi, and July in Burkina Faso. During model development, effective EO features are also identified, such as precipitation and available water during VP, and dry days and extreme temperatures in early VP. Compared to monthly standard EO features, sub-monthly (dekadal), non-standard, and serial EO features significantly improve forecast skills by + 0.3 NSE and-10% of MAPE, demonstrating the ability to precisely and effectively capture favorable or detrimental crop development conditions. Finally, skillful forecasts and practical utility are demonstrated in the recent normal and dry years in each region. Overall, the developed yield forecasting system can provide skillful predictions during the growing season, supporting regional and international agricultural decision-making processes, including informing food-security planning and management, thereby helping to mitigate food shortages caused by unfavorable climate conditions.},

Meteorological data provide input for hydroclimatic models and predictions, which generally lack complete series. Many studies have addressed techniques to fill gaps in precipitation series at annual and monthly scales, but few have provided results at a daily scale due to the complexity of orographic characteristics and in some cases the non-linearity of precipitation. The objective of this study was to assess different methods of filling gaps in daily precipitation data using regression model (RM) and machine learning (ML) techniques. RM included linear regression (LRM) and multiple regression (MRM) algorithms, while ML included multiple regression algorithms (ML-MRM), K-nearest neighbors (ML-KNN), gradient boosting trees (ML-GBT), and random forest (ML-RF). This study covered the Malas, Omas, and Canete River (MOC) watersheds, which are located on the Pacific Slope of central Peru, and a nineteen-year period of records (2001-2019). To assess model performance, different statistical metrics were applied. The results showed that the optimized machine learning (OML) models presented the least variability in estimation errors and the best approximation of the actual data from the study zone. In addition, this investigation shows that ML interprets and analyzes non-linear relationships between rain gauges at a daily scale and can be used as an efficient method of filling gaps in daily precipitation series.},

In this study, we attempted to use an artificial neural network (ANN) for summer precipitation forecasts in the Yangtze-Huaihe River Basin (YHRB), eastern China. The major ANN employed here is the standard backpropagation neural network (BPNN), which was modified for application to the YHRB. Using the analysis data of precipitation and the predictors/factors of atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature, we calculated the correlation coefficients between precipitation and the factors. In addition, we sorted the top six factors for precipitation forecasts. In order to obtain accurate forecasts, month (factor)-to-month (precipitation) forecast models were applied over the training and validation periods (i.e., summer months over 1979-2011 and 2012-2019, respectively). We compared the standard BPNN with the BPNN using a genetic algorithm-based backpropagation (GABP), support vector machine (SVM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) for the summer precipitation forecast after the model training period, and found that the GABP method is the best among the above methods for precipitation forecasting, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of approximately 20% for the YHRB, which is substantially lower than the BPNN, SVM and MLR values. We then selected the best summer precipitation forecast of the GABP month-to-month models by summing up monthly precipitation, in order to obtain the summer scale forecast, which presents a very successful performance in terms of evaluation measures. For example, the basin-averaged MAPE and anomaly rate reach 4.7% and 88.3%, respectively, for the YHRB, which can be a good recommendation for future operational services. It appears that sea surface temperatures (SST) in some key areas dominate the factors for the forecasts. These results indicate the potential of applying GABP to summer precipitation forecasts in the YHRB.},

   abstract = {Runoff information and its dynamics are critical for supporting watershed management; however, spatio-temporal data about runoff is rare or unavailable in data-scarce regions. Information about the performance of remote sensing-based runoff and its potential application is limitedly known. In data-scarce regions, this condition impedes comprehensive watershed assessment especially in the midst of climate change impacts. This study examined the performance of globally available monthly runoff dataset provided by TerraClimate at similar to 4 km spatial resolution and employed them to assess the runoff dynamics in a humid tropic watershed. Monthly TerraClimate data shows a moderate performance with an r of 0.63, RMSE of 57-127 mm/month and NRMSE of 18-30% to the simulated runoff from a well-calibrated model. The upper region of Brantas watershed was found to be the hotspot of high runoff. About 25% of the study area belongs to high runoff (0-33rd percentile). Over the last two decades, runoff has been slightly increased across the study area. Green vegetation fraction (GVF), precipitation, and topography are critical for regulating runoff dynamics. While topography and precipitation impact on runoff are straightforward, the GVF's role is complex and site-specific. High runoff was found mostly to be associated with high precipitation and steep slope. GVF appears to be less effective in representing ground cover against runoff generation due to high variability of actual ground cover types. Using time-series and change vector analysis (CVA) of runoff and GVF, the dynamics of watershed condition was examined. Long-term CVA analysis also found that the condition in Brantas watershed was fluctuated with slight increase in impaired condition. The study exemplified the potential use of the remote sensing-based runoff data in a tropical data-scarce region. Despite limitation of the runoff data due to its moderate performance, the globally available monthly runoff data from TerraClimate can be used to support regional water resource assessment in data-scare regions. Future improvement that includes downscaling and use of machine learning can be considered to improve the remotely sensed runoff data to deliver the bigger benefits of such data.},

   abstract = {Deep lakes under climate change are experiencing reduced deep mixing, with a consequent increase in nutrients concentration and oxygen deficit in the hypolimnion. From this perspective, greater efforts should be made to reduce the phosphorus load delivered to these lakes by their tributaries. An essential precondition for this action is a reliable estimate of the loads, which is challenging due to the marked temporal variability of the hydrologically-driven diffuse sources. In this article, we used a high-resolution phosphorus time series measured at the mouth of the main tributary of Lake Iseo and a machine learning algorithm to show the dominant role played by the acute, storm-dependent transport. The results emphasize the need to control loads strictly linked to precipitation and runoff in the drained watershed, representing 31% of the observed events but responsible for 64% of the overall load to the lake. We also proved evidence that the current obligations on nutrients monitoring miss the total phosphorus dynamics, leading to a systematic underestimation of the load conveyed by the inflows. Accordingly, we propose a sampling methodology where the timing and the methods for data interpolation are established according to the hydrological conditions in the drained watershed. Accounting for the economical and practical constraints imposed by the monitoring authorities, we propose to integrate, at the mouth of lake tributaries, a monthly manual sampling with an auto-sampler programmed to fill 2 bottles in correspondence of each high flow event. Our simulations showed that in this case the load estimation error was reduced below 1%, implying, on average, 13 field surveys/year and 21 laboratory analyses/year only. It is reasonable to expect comparable performances in hydrologically similar watersheds.},

Its accurate prediction is therefore vital for planning and managing farmers' plantations. Rainfall plays an important role in the symmetry of the water cycle, and many hydrological models use rainfall as one of their components. This paper aimed to investigate the applicability of six machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e., M5 model tree: (M5), random forest: (RF), support vector regression with polynomial (SVR-poly) and RBF kernels (SVR- RBF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and long-short-term memory (LSTM) in predicting for multiple-month ahead of monthly rainfall. The experiment was set up for two weather gauged stations located in the Thale Sap Songkhla basin. The model development was carried out by (1) selecting input variables, (2) tuning hyperparameters, (3) investigating the influence of climate variables on monthly rainfall prediction, and (4) predicting monthly rainfall with multi-step-ahead prediction. Four statistical indicators including correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and overall index (OI) were used to assess the model's effectiveness. The results revealed that large-scale climate variables, particularly sea surface temperature, were significant influence variables for rainfall prediction in the tropical climate region. For projections of the Thale Sap Songkhla basin as a whole, the LSTM model provided the highest performance for both gauged stations. The developed predictive rainfall model for two rain gauged stations provided an acceptable performance: r (0.74), MAE (86.31 mm), RMSE (129.11 mm), and OI (0.70) for 1 month ahead, r (0.72), MAE (91.39 mm), RMSE (133.66 mm), and OI (0.68) for 2 months ahead, and r (0.70), MAE (94.17 mm), RMSE (137.22 mm), and OI (0.66) for 3 months ahead.},

This research aimed to examine the capability of machine learning (ML) and spatial interpolation (SI) methods to estimate missing monthly rainfall data. Six ML algorithms (i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), M5 model tree (M5), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), genetic programming (GP)) and four SI methods (i.e. arithmetic average (AA), inverse distance weighting (IDW), correlation coefficient weighted (CCW), normal ratio (NR)) were investigated and compared in their performance. The twelve rainfall stations, located in the Thale Sap Songkhla river basin and nearby basins, were considered as a study case. Tuning hyper-parameters for each ML method was conducted to get the most suitable model for the data sets considered. Three performance criteria matrices (i.e. NSE, OI, and r) were chosen, and the sum of those three performance criteria matrices was introduced for methods' performance comparison. The experimental results pointed out that selecting neighbouring stations were essential when applying SI methods, but not for the ML method. The overall performance showed ML better imputed missing monthly rainfall than SI due to overcoming spatial constraints. GP provided the highest performance by giving NSE = 0.825, OI = 0.877, and r = 0.909 for the training stage. Those values for the testing stage were 0.796, 0.852, and 0.902, respectively. It was followed by SVR-rbf, SVR-poly, and RF. NR provided the best performance among four SI methods, followed by CCW, AA, and IDW. When applying SI methods, it should contemplate a correlation between the target and neighbouring stations greater than 0.80.},

Using monthly fire counts observed by the MODIS satellites in combination with temperature and precipitation data, indices of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies (teleconnections), and global temperature anomalies (GT), a combined wavelet-machine learning approach is developed to identify drivers of variability in global wildfire counts on a monthly scale. Precipitation and temperature are found to be the most important predictors of wildfire count in all regions. In addition, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and GT are identified as the two major drivers of wildfire occurrence. Results indicate that the record-breaking 2019 wildfires in the Asian Arctic can be attributed to unusually warm and dry weather, while the recent increase in wildfires in Amazonia rather can be attributed to regional human activities.},

   abstract = {The rapid acceleration of the global water cycle caused by changes in global climate trigger complex processes that make conventional machine learning techniques limited in assessing impacts of such changes on terrestrial water storage (TWS). This study introduces an assimilated deep learning neural network to improve the modeling of TWS dynamics. Key predictors and inputs to this deep learning framework include runoff, rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, global teleconnection patterns and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The proposed back propagation model in this study capitalizes on the availability of remotely sensed observations and model datasets to predict monthly TWS, a quantity that is difficult to observe in the field, but important for the esti-mation of regional water budget balance, and water resource management for agricultural purposes. By inte-grating pre-processed outputs from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) into our network using a deep neural pattern, we synthesized TWS from 2002 to 2017, and also made future predictions using our trained models. Results from these analyses showed that the ICA-BPNN model has a higher predictive accuracy compared to the PCA-BPNN. These models (ICA-BPNN and PCA-BPNN) were used to fit the three dominant temporal patterns of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) - observed TWS over Africa. Our simulation results from the testing phase indicate that the fits for the prediction of the first three leading modes of TWS for both models when compared to the observed GRACE-TWS were PCA-BPNN1 (89%), PCA-BPNN2 (82%), PCA-BPNN3 (84%) and ICA-BPNN1 (93%), ICA-BPNN2 (88%), ICA-BPNN3 (82%). The simulation fit of the BPNN corresponding to multi-annual time series, which are captured in the second and third orthogonal modes and localized patterns of TWS were lower than those of annual signals in both the PCA-and ICA-BPNN models. This was attributed to the fact that the multi-annual time series in GRACE -hydrological signals of our test-bed are complex compared to the annual patterns of TWS. On the one hand, this exemplifies the superior performance of our predictive framework in modeling naturalized system (annual changes in TWS driven by only climatic factors). On the other hand, the complexity in modelling multi-annual variations in TWS suggests heavily disturbed naturalized systems evidenced in the presence of human water management operations among other anthropogenic activities.},

In this study, SVM, RF, and ANN machine learning algorithms were tested to forecast the monthly storage rate of agricultural reservoirs. The storage rate observed over 30 years (1991-2022) was set as a label, and nine datasets for a one- to three-month storage rate forecast were constructed using precipitation and evapotranspiration as features. In all, 70% of the total data was used for training and validation, and the remaining 30% was used as a test. The one-month storage rate forecasting showed that all SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms were highly reliable, with R-2 values >= 0.8. As a result of the storage rate forecast for two and three months, the ANN and SVM algorithms showed relatively reasonable explanatory power with an average R-2 of 0.64 to 0.69, but the RF algorithm showed a large generalization error. The results of comparing the learning time showed that the learning speed was the fastest in the order of SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms in all of the one to three months. Overall, the learning performance of SVM and ANN algorithms was better than RF. The SVM algorithm is the most credible, with the lowest error rates and the shortest training time. The results of this study are expected to provide the scientific information necessary for the decision-making regarding on-site water managers, which is expected to be possible through the connection with weather forecast data.},

Using daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and three emissivity bands (3.929-3.989 mu m, 10.780-11.280 mu m, and 11.770-12.270 mu m) as the model inputs, the simulated site-scale monthly dew yield achieved a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.89 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.30 (mm) for the training set, and CC = 0.59 and RMSE = 0.55 (mm) for the test set. Applying the model to the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the results showed that the annual dew yield ranged from 8.83 to 20.28 mm/year, accounting for 2.12 to 66.88% of the total precipitation, with 74.81% of the area having an annual dew amount of 16 to 19 mm/year. We expanded the model application to Northwest China and obtained a dew yield of 5 similar to 30 mm/year from 2011 to 2020, indicating that dew is a non-negligible part of the water balance in this arid area.

We concluded that the three machine learning algorithms showed better model performance than the baseline model as they reflected non-linear energy use characteristics for water transfer systems. Among the three machine learning algorithms, DNN models yielded higher model performance than RF and SVR models. Subsystems performed better than the whole system as the models more closely reflected the unique energy use characteristics of the subsystems. The best case was having water supply (t), water supply (t-1), precipitation (t), temperature (t), and population (y) as independent variables.

In this paper, multiple machine learning techniques, i.e., statistical downscaling model (SDSM), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were used to downscale large-scale climatic variables simulated by the General Circulation Models (GCMs) to precipitation on a local scale. It was demonstrated in Shenzhen city, China, through multisite downscaling schemes based on projections from the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.2-HR), Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model Version 2.0 (MRI-ESM2.0), and Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM2-MR). The obtained results showed that the downscaled precipitation would provide good monthly simulations against observations at 10 discrete stations. Regardless of superior performance of SVM and MLP over SDSM, the daily precipitation simulations should be further improved, and downscaling of heavy daily precipitations would be promoted by quantile mapping corrections. Due to the relatively poor simulation performance of BCC-CSM2-MR, the other two climate models were considered under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios) for ensemble precipitation projections for 2015-2100. Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the amounts of annual average precipitation for 10 stations were estimated to be higher relative to the historical period (2.7%-17%), and 9 out of 10 stations presented an increasing trend. However, downward trends also existed at three stations when it comes to scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. Moreover, a significantly positive trend was found to dominate the trend changes of annual extreme daily precipitation during 2015-2050, but the detected trends at stations were greatly dependent on the downscaling techniques and climate models. Besides, the increase in daily extreme precipitations for various return periods as well as statistically different precipitation characteristics for discrete stations would further shed light on urgent demands on urban resilient strategies for climate change adaptation.},

This paper presents the first report utilizing machine learning and historical aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination levels in-order-to develop models that can confidently predict mycotoxin contamination of corn in Illinois, a major corn producing state in the USA. Historical monthly meteorological data from a 14-year period combined with corresponding aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination data from the State of Illinois were used to engineer input features that link weather, fungal growth, and aflatoxin production in combination with gradient boosting (GBM) and bayesian network (BN) modeling. The GBM and BN models developed can predict mycotoxin contamination with overall 94% accuracy. Analyses for aflatoxin and fumonisin with GBM showed that meteorological and satellite-acquired vegetative index data during March significantly influenced grain contamination at the end of the corn growing season. Prediction of high aflatoxin contamination levels was linked to high aflatoxin risk index in March/June/July, high vegetative index in March and low vegetative index in July. Correspondingly, high levels of fumonisin contamination were linked to high precipitation levels in February/March/September and high vegetative index in March. During corn flowering time in June, higher temperatures range increased prediction of high levels of fumonisin contamination, while high aflatoxin contamination levels were linked to high aflatoxin risk index. Meteorological events prior to corn planting in the field have high influence on predicting aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination levels at the end of the year. These early-year events detected by the models can directly assist farmers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to prevent mycotoxin contamination of Illinois grown corn.},

   abstract = {Dry days at varied scale are an important topic in climate discussions. Prolonged dry days define a dry period. Dry days with a specific rainfall threshold may visualize a climate scenario of a locality. The variation of monthly dry days from station to station could be correlated with several climatic factors. This study suggests a novel approach for predicting monthly dry days (MDD) of six target stations using different machine learning (ML) algorithms in Bangladesh. Several rainfall thresholds were used to prepare the datasets of monthly dry days (MDD) and monthly wet days (MWD). A group of ML algorithms, like Bagged Trees (BT), Exponential Gaussian Process Regression (EGPR), Matern Gaussian Process Regression (MGPR), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Fine Trees (FT) and Linear Regression (LR) were evaluated on building a competitive prediction model of MDD. In validation of the study, EGPR-based models were able to better capture the monthly dry days (MDD) over Bangladesh compared to those by MGPR, LSVM, BT, LR and FT-based models. When MDD were the predictors for all six target stations, EGPR produced highest mean R-2 of 0.91 (min. 0.89 and max. 0.92) with a least mean RMSE of 2.14 (min. 1.78 and max. 2.69) compared to other models. An explicit evaluation of the ML algorithms using one-year lead time approach demonstrated that BT and EGPR were the most result-oriented algorithms (R-2 = 0.78 for both models). However, having a least RMSE, EGPR was chosen as the best model in one year lead time. The dataset of monthly dry-wet days was the best predictor in the lead-time approach. In addition, sensitivity analysis demonstrated sensitivity of each station on the prediction of MDD of target stations. Monte Carlo simulation was introduced to assess the robustness of the developed models. EGPR model declared its robustness up to certain limit of randomness on the testing data. The output of this study can be referred to the agricultural sector to mitigate the impacts of dry spells on agriculture.},

   abstract = {The present research examined the potential of two important feature selection methods, Bayesian Networks (BN) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), in identifying the optimum predictors for forecasting rainfall in the Godavari Basin in India. Initially, a set of `probable hydro-climatological variables' is chosen based on previous studies. Following a correlation analysis between these probable predictors and monthly rainfall, the most correlated contiguous zones were chosen as `potential predictors' which were subsequently used as inputs to the two feature selection algorithms, BN and RFE for selecting the `optimum predictors'. The optimum predictions were further utilised to develop seven state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Parallel Multi-Population Genetic Programming (PMPGP (5 demes (Case 1), 9 demes (Case 2), and 17 demes (Case 3)). The result of the correlation analysis revealed that the domain for Relative Humidity, Total Precipitable Water should be considered over the study area, and for U-Wind, V-Wind and Surface Pressure, the zones around Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf should be considered respectively. BN, as a feature selection technique for choosing the optimum predictors, was found to be more effective than RFE. In terms of prediction models, GPR and PMPGP models outperformed others, both when used alone and in conjunction with feature selection methods. The R-2 values for GPR models vary from 0.82-0.41, whereas the same varies from 0.81-0.31 for PMPGP models.},

We augmented the limitations of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to model salinity by coupling with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a decision-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm. Streamflow, precipitation, elevation, main reach length, and dominant soil texture of the top two layers were used along with NO3, NO2, and total phosphorus (TP) output from a calibrated SWAT model are used as predictors to Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the XGBoost algorithm. Then, the SWAT model simulations of streamflow, NO3+NO2, and TP from 2000 to 2015 are used as inputs of the XGBoost model to predict monthly water TDS distribution along the river. The predicted river water TDS showed a higher concentration as going downstream from El Paso (inlet) through the Hudspeth canal to Fort Quitman (outlet). Finally, this study carried out cause analysis focusing on soil physical characteristics. The soil salinity level is directly affected by the soil permeability and irrigation water. As a result, the highest TDS is shown in sites with silt loam, whereas the lowest TDS was shown in sites with very cobbly soil. Silt soils can hold more water and are slower to drain than soils of a sand type. These analyses can be used to better understand the mitigation of water salinity.},

Rainfall prediction is a substantial progression in giving input data for weather information and hydrological development applications. In machine learning, accurate and efficient rainfall predictionis used to support strategy for watershed management. The prediction of rain is a problematic occurrence and endures to be a challenging task. This paper implements a novel algorithm for preprocessing and optimization using historical weather from a collection of various weather parameters. The Moving Average-Probabilistic Regression Filtering (MV-PRF) method eliminates unwanted samples with less amplitude from the database. The Time Variant Particle Swarm Optimization (TVPSO) model optimizes the preprocessing rainfall data. Then this optimized data is used for the different classification processes. The preprocessing methods emphasize the recent rainfall data of the time series to improve the rainfall forecast using classification methods. Machine Learning (ML) technique classifies the weather parameters to predict rainfall daily or monthly. These experimental results show that the proposed methods are efficient and accurate for rainfall analysis.},

The accuracy of reservoir inflow forecasting is one of the essential factors supporting reservoir operations. This study aimed to investigate coupling models of feature selection (FS) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the monthly reservoir inflow. The study was carried out using data from the Huai Nam Sai reservoir in southern Thailand. Eighteen years of monthly recorded data (i.e., reservoir inflow, reservoir storage, rainfall, and regional climate indices) with up to a 12-month time lag were utilized. Three ML techniques, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN)were compared in their capabilities. In addition, two FS techniques, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and backward elimination (BE) methods, were studied with four predictable time intervals, consisting of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in advance. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for model evaluation. Study results revealed that FS methods (i.e., GA and BE) Could improve the performance of SVR and ANN for predicting monthly reservoir inflow forecasting, but they have no effects on MLR. Different developed forecasting models were suitable for different reservoir inflow forecasting time-step-ahead. BE-ANN provided the best performance for three-time-ahead (T + 3) and nine-time-ahead (T + 9) by giving an OI of 0.9885 and 0.8818, NSE of 0.9546 and 0.9815, RMSE of 1.3155 and 1.2172 MCM/month, MAE of 0.9568 and 0.9644 MCM/month, and r of 0.9796 and 0.9804, respectively.

The purpose of this study is to assess rainfall erosivity (monthly and annual), testing machine learning algorithms aided by a covariate bank for spatial prediction of rainfall erosivity in Southeastern Brazil. The modeling tested Random Forest-RF, Cubist, Support Vector Machine, Earth, and Linear Model, associated with 154 covariates (topographic, climatic, and vegetation data). However, we apply the cut-off correlation function (findcorrelation) and feature selection algorithm (Recursive Feature Elimination-RFE) to select strong covariates. Our results show that the RF algorithm was more efficient in modeling (R-2 values between 0.29 and 0.82), whit the best metrics in the low rainfall period (winter). The modeling showed fluidity by selecting only 43 significant covariates due to the findcorrelation and RFE functions. The most important and frequent covariates in spatial modeling were coordinates, water deficit, topographical, and climatic data. In general, the spatial results show that the dynamics of rainfall erosivity is strongly affected by factors of air mass circulation, relief, and geographic position. Our approach is promising as it is a method capable of estimating rainfall erosivity in unsampled areas, capturing information from significant spatial covariates.},

The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) data store provides open access to monthly hydrological forecasts for up to six-months. This study aims to evaluate, for the first time, 1- to 3-month runoff forecasts using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensembles of precipitation, runoff, and temperature in 1981–2015 period over a total of 30 s-level basins in Iran. We adopted the 5th, 50th and 95th ECMWF ensemble quantiles for each variable that represent low, medium and high probability of occurrence, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis (Pca), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) via random forest (RF) model, and Bayesian Networks (BN) feature selection algorithms were used in order to reduce input variable dimension and select potential predictors to be fed to the machine learning models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models were used with Repeated K-Fold cross validation (rK-Fold CV) while model efficiency was evaluated using modified Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE’), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE), and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). Results of this study revealed that C3S runoff ensembles have the highest impact on forecast accuracy of streamflow, followed by precipitation and temperature. Overall, model performance yield a best-to-worst ranking of ANN, XGBoost, RF, MLR, and SVR with KGE’ values of 0.70, 0.68, 0.66, 0.57, and 0.41, respectively. The predictive performance of all models decreased with lead times beyond 1-month, where ANN and XGBoost outperformed other models with KGE’ of 0.65 for 2-month lead time and 0.60 for 3-month lead time. The three superior models of XGBoost, ANN, and RF, were employed with RFE and BN FSAs most frequently across Iran’s 30 s level basins in all lead times. Almost all models in the arid central region of Iran showed the lowest performance while highest skills were achieved in the western regions of Iran. Finally, for all models and over all regions, the model performance reduced by increase in lead-time.},

In this study, a comprehensive remote sensing-based Agriculture Drought Condition Indicator (CADCI) was developed to monitor the agriculture drought in semi-arid environments and assess its effectiveness in rainfed agriculture regions in (A) Jordan and (B) Syria. First, remote sensed-based drought-condition spectral indices [i.e., Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Evapotranspiration Condition Index (ETCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI)] were calculated using data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite (MODIS) [Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and evapotranspiration (ET)]; the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPMs); the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAPs); and Sentinel-1A. Second, Random Forest (RF) was used to estimate and determine the relative importance of these indices based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values to select the three spectral indices that have the most monthly short-term relative importance in identifying the agriculture drought for semi-arid environments, which were PCI, TCI, and VCI. Third, these indices were integrated to identify the drought severity based on specific thresholds that compare the pixel-specific value with the study area average value. For instance, a severe drought condition is identified if all three indices indicate a drought condition, a moderate drought or mild drought conditions are identified if any two or any one of the indices indicate drought conditions, respectively. Lastly, a none drought condition is identified if none of the indices indicate a drought condition. Finally, the SPI sets for 1 and 3-months (SPI-1 and SPI-3) were used to evaluate the performance of the CADCI. The results showed the CADCI has a high agreement with SPI-1 classes in the study areas, with overall accuracy and Kappa-values of 85% and 0.80, for study area A and 83% and 0.76 for study area B, respectively. Consequently, the CADCI shows its ability to monitor agricultural drought in semi-arid environments. Perhaps, it could be applicable for larger areas due to the spatial resolution of the input dataset.},

   abstract = {Water allocation models (WAM) can capture complex feedbacks between water infrastructure, water supply, water demand, and water rights structure. They are an important tool for water managers to reduce conflict and aid in future water resource planning. Future streamflow reductions and shifts in timing are anticipated in snow-dominated watersheds of the western United States due to projected reductions in snow water storage. These basins tend to be water-limited and rely on groundwater to support agricultural demand. Water managers in the snow-fed, agricultural Walker River Basin (WRB) in California and Nevada use a dynamically coupled WAM and physically based groundwater flow model as a decision support tool. Large computation time is required to simulate groundwater dynamics, limiting the number of model scenarios that can feasibly be run to test alternative management scenarios under climate change. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been used to capture complex nonlinear hydrologic dynamics in other contexts, but to our knowledge there have not been efforts to use ML to increase computational efficiency in modeling groundwater responses to agricultural water use. We use extreme gradient boosting to replace the groundwater sub-model for the WRB decision support tool, resulting in accurate estimates of reservoir storage (monthly error almost always < 5% of reservoir capacity), streamflow (total outflow errors from −3% to 20% depending on scenario) and agricultural water shortages (-12% to 18% error in total shortage depending on scenario). For comparison, we found that omitting groundwater modeling from the WAM results in a larger overprediction of outflows (2 to 58%) and underprediction in agricultural water shortages (0 to 41%) across a range of scenarios. We use this validated ML method to explore the sensitivity of agricultural water availability to a range of streamflow volumes and streamflow timings. Results indicate that agricultural water shortages are more sensitive to annual streamflow volume in comparison to shifts in streamflow timing. Our model shows that reservoirs can buffer the impact of altered flow timing on agricultural production, except under extreme conditions in which all precipitation falls as rain (no snow storage) and streamflow peaks in the winter. Future work will explore these thresholds in more detail. While the results here are site-specific, the methodology for coupling a WAM with a ML representation of surface–groundwater interactions can be applied to a wide variety of water resource modeling applications. These results also provide a stark example of the importance of snowpack storage and groundwater management to western US water infrastructure.},

   abstract = {Determining the characteristics of rainfall erosivity at different times and locations is significant for global and regional soil erosion prevention and control. However, accurate quantification of rainfall erosivity remains a challenge due to the limitations of high-precision and long-time series precipitation data. Here, compared with the rainfall erosivity of 291 meteorological stations on the Chinese Loess Plateau, we evaluated the distribution characteristics and accuracy of rainfall erosivity on different temporal and spatial scales calculated by the ERA5 precipitation dataset. A random forest model was constructed to generate a bias dataset to correct the annual rainfall erosivity. Besides, the relationship between erosivity density (ED) and rainfall patterns was quantified to clarify the characteristics of rainfall erosivity. Conducted analysis suggested that the rainfall erosivity calculated from the ERA5 precipitation dataset has high accuracy on average annual, seasonal and monthly scales, and the R2 were 0.62, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively. The addition of the random forest model further optimized the result of average annual rainfall erosivity of ERA5, with root mean square error (RMSE) and absolute value of relative bias (BIAS) decreasing to 185.7 MJ mm ha−1h−1 a−1 and 2.17%, respectively. Meanwhile, ERA5 can well capture the average annual rainfall erosivity in different spaces of the study area. The high correlation between erosivity density and rainstorms (R2 = 0.87) indicated that a larger proportion of rainstorms in erosive rainfall will lead to a greater potential risk of soil erosion. These findings provide a reliable approach to accurately obtain the variable rainfall erosivity in areas with complex terrain and sparse stations, and have important implications for soil sustainability.},

In this study, a new multi-decomposition deep learning-based technique was proposed to forecast monthly rainfall in Himalayan region of India (i.e., Haridwar and Nainital). In the first stage, the original rainfall signals as the individual accessible datasets were decomposed into intrinsic mode decomposition functions (IMFs) through the time-varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD) technique, and then the significant lagged values were computed from the decomposed sub-sequences (i.e., IMFs) using the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). In the second stage, the PACF-based decomposed IMFs signals were again decomposed by the Singular Valued Decomposition (SVD) approach to reduce the dimensionality and enhance the forecasting accuracy. The machine learning approaches including the bidirectional long-short term memory reinforced with the Encoder-Decoder Bidirectional (EDBi-LSTM), Adaptive Boosting Regression (Adaboost), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Random Forest (RF) were used to construct the hybrid forecasting models. Also, several statistical metrics i.e., correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and graphical interpretation tools were employed to evaluate the hybrid (TVF-EMD-SVD-RF, TVF-EMD-SVD-EDBi-LSTM, TVF-EMD-SVD-Adaboost, and TVF-EMD-SVD-GRNN) and standalone counterpart (EDBi-LSTM, Adaboost, RF, and GRNN) models. The outcomes of monthly rainfall forecasting ascertain that the TVF-EMD-SVD-EDBi-LSTM in the Haridwar (R = 0.5870, RMSE = 118.4782 mm, and NSE = 0.3116) and Nainital (R = 0.9698, RMSE = 44.3963 mm, NSE = 0.9388) outperformed the benchmarking models.},

Machine learning techniques have been widely used to predict floods based on precipitation, humidity, temperature, water velocity, and level variables. However, most prior studies have examined the monthly rainfall intensity to determine the likelihood of flooding. As a result, a state's daily and monthly rainfall intensity has been used to train deep-learning models to predict floods. In addition, feature reduction approaches are critical for dealing with data of a large dimensionality and improving classification accuracy. This article utilizes improved Principal Component Analysis (i-PCA), a linear unsupervised statistical transformation, as a feature reduction procedure. A 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model forecasts the flood based on the reduced features. The experiments are based on a dataset of daily and monthly rainfall data collected from 1901 to 2021 for Kerala state. Qualitative analysis is performed using precision, accuracy, recall and F1-score parameters. The experiment analysis proves that the proposed algorithm attained 94.24% accuracy, and existing techniques achieved 86% of accuracy performance. The reason is that the proposed model uses the improved PCA for the feature reduction technique.},

We studied the effects of climate change on the groundwater level for the important Dehgolan Aquifer in northwestern Iran. The water level in this aquifer has dropped by about 35 m during the last 30 years. Soft computing techniques were used together with climate projections in three methodological steps to estimate the groundwater level drop by 2045. Firstly, MODFLOW was used to simulate groundwater flow and movement. Secondly, simulation results, support vector regression (SVR), and least-squares SVR (LSSVR) machine learning models were used to predict groundwater levels for the future 20-year period (2026–2045). The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) was used to improve the prediction results by optimizing the SVR parameters. Thirdly, three climate models of CMIP6 (ACCESS-CM2, BCC-CSM2-MR, and CMCC-ESM2) were used to predict the changes in precipitation for the future period (2026–2045) using SSP 2.6 and SSP 8.5 scenarios. The results showed that the MODFLOW-LSSVR model predicted the groundwater level more accurately than MODFLOW-SVR and MODFLOW-SVR-WOA. The calculation scenario containing previous month groundwater level, monthly aquifer withdrawal, and monthly precipitation had the highest performance in predicting groundwater level with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) equal to 0.305 m, 0.014 m, and 0.998, respectively. The results indicate that precipitation may decrease in the future period for the SSP 8.5 scenario (about 6% compared to the reference period 1987–2005). This decrease, along with the continuation of the current aquifer withdrawal, will cause a drop of about 36 m (during 28 years) of the groundwater level (1.3 m per year). The results reveal that the drop could be reduced to 12 m by adopting a 25% reduction in the current aquifer withdrawal. The findings show the necessity of providing a suitable management approach to prevent future aquifer exhaustion due to the continuation of the current withdrawal situation in the region.},

   abstract = {In the semi-arid Central Andes of Argentina, the water from snowmelt runoff plays a fundamental role as a provider of ecosystem services. Nowadays, the global climate change has an observable negative impact on this area, due, principally, to the decrease in both liquid and solid rainfall, with the consequent decrease in water availability. In this context, runoff prediction acquires vital importance for the integrated water resources management. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique in predicting monthly discharges with 1-month lead-time in the Tupungato River basin in the Central Andes of Argentina. This methodology has never been applied before in this mountainous region. Different inputs, like meteorological data and satellite-based snow cover area estimates from MODIS, were analyzed in order to identify the suitable inputs predictors to forecast monthly streamflow. The results were compared against the results derived from a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model and, also, against an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving-average (ARIMA) model. Different metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the SVR tests in reproducing streamflow observations at the basin outlet. The coefficient of determination for each of the analyzed tests lays between 0.75 and 0.89 in the validation set. The comparison with the other models showed a significant improvement in performance of SVR in respect of CART and ARIMA model. SVR models proved a promising approach to support water management and decision making for productive activities, potentially also in other basins in the region.},

   abstract = {This study describes a comprehensive investigation of the contiguous United States precipitation patterns in relation to the warm and cold phases of El Niño/southern Oscillation (ENSO) using a set of empirical and statistical analyses, such as harmonic analysis, annual cycle composites, and cross-correlation analysis. Monthly precipitation composites for the first harmonic, covering 24-month ENSO events, are formed for all climate divisions over the United States spanning up to 29 ENSO episodes. From the harmonic vectorial maps plotted on the study area, each vector reveals both intensity and temporal phase of the ENSO-related precipitation teleconnection, and the corresponding candidate and core regions are determined using a machine learning technique of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based on magnitude and temporal phase of climate signal, and Köppen climate classification. As a result of vectorial mapping, five core regions were designated as North-West region (NW), South-West region (SW), Middle-Inland region (MI), South-East region (SE), and North-East region (NE). During fall (0) to spring (+) seasons, the results of this analysis show below (above) normal precipitation response to the El Niño events at the NW region (SW, MI, SE, and NE regions), while the opposite patterns are detected for the cold phase of ENSO. The temporal consistency values were 0.72 to 0.86 (0.77 to 0.82), and spatial coherence values ranged from 0.96 to 0.99 (0.94 to 0.99) for the warm (cold) events. Comparative analyses of precipitation responses to both El Niño and La Niña events reveal the high significance level of the ENSO-related precipitation signals with an opposite tendency in monthly precipitation anomalies. Positive precipitation anomalies during the El Niño thermal forcing are more significant than negative precipitation departures during the La Niña events. Consequently, middle latitude precipitation responses to the El Niño/La Niña phenomena are detectable over the contiguous United States.},

   abstract = {Baseflow, the groundwater contribution to streamflow, sustains surface water between precipitation events and is an important indicator of groundwater availability. Although many site-specific studies have been completed, there are few studies of long-term Canada-wide baseflow trends. In this work, we detected monthly baseflow trends across Canada and related them to changes to climatic predictors (precipitation, temperature, and antecedent wetness) using streamflow data from 1275 hydrometer stations from 1989 to 2019. Lyne and Hollick’s one-parameter digital filter is used to obtain a baseflow time series and monotonic trends are identified using the Mann-Kendall Trend Test. Historical baseflow is related to climate parameters by means of Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) statistical analysis. Results based on trend analysis detected no significant trends for most stations (85.7% of all stations and months). However, notable increasing trends were observed across most of southern Canada during the winter and spring months (October–April). Conversely, negative trends were detected from June to September in Alberta and British Columbia and in southern Northwest Territories. Model selection identified antecedent wetness most often as a climate predictor over the same period as trend analysis. Our results highlight that warmer temperatures and increased snow cover across much of Canada have contributed to increased baseflow likely from shifts in snow melt timing and volumes. During warmer months (June–August), results indicate that increases in temperature were related to decreased baseflow, likely through increased evapotranspiration. Many trends in baseflow were not related to any climate predictors. Furthermore, non-reference basins were twice as likely to have no climate predictor, indicating that anthropogenic activities may be driving changes in baseflow. The results of this work can inform water resources management to identify the direction of change in groundwater availability across Canada and regions where mitigation may be necessary.},

We have used different meteorological variables (i.e., relative humidity, temperature, and rainfall) as input features to predict malaria. We have also considered the combined impact of these variables through a linear data fusion. We then extract the uncorrelated information from the feature set by applying Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (P2CA). We trained the fully connected feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) by optimising its hyperparameters iteratively through a bio-inspired optimisation algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimisation). We train and evaluate the performance of this algorithm using monthly meteorological variables from 2009 - 2012. This accurately predicts the malaria cases with the coefficient of correlation (R = 0.99), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 1.76). Finally, we compare our model with different benchmark algorithms (Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN)) in terms of accuracy. We observed the performance of hybrid machine learning model relatively high.

   abstract = {Estimation of total water availability has paramount importance in planning sustainable development of a region, particularly in arid water-scarce areas. Coarse-resolution of existing total water availability or terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data is the major limitation of their applications in different sectors. An attempt has been made to downscale Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) TWSA data to develop a high-resolution gridded data product of the total water availability of Iraq. European reanalysis (ERA5) precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, subsurface runoff and soil water contents data were used to downscale GRACE 1.0° spatial resolution monthly TWSA to 0.1° spatial resolution for the period 2002–2020. A machine learning (ML)-based recursive feature elimination algorithm was used to identify the optimum input combination according to the nonlinear relationship of ERA5 variables with GRACE water equivalence data. The selected subset of inputs was used to develop the downscaling models using three classical ML algorithms for the available GRACE measurement points over Iraq. The models were calibrated at 70% of GRACE grid point locations and validated in the rest of the points. Finally, the model was used to predict TWSA at each ERA5 grid point to generate Iraq's high-resolution water availability dataset. The results showed higher performance of random forest in downscaling TWSA compared to other algorithms. The model estimated the TWSA at validation points with Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) in the range of 0.5–0.91 and Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) between 0.54 and 0.88. The modelled high-resolution TWSA data shows higher availability of water resources in the north, particularly northeast of Iraq, and the least in the southeast. The technique developed in this study can be implemented in developing a high-resolution gridded water availability dataset from satellite GRACE data in the region where in-situ estimation is very limited.},

This study proposes an improved AI model, Augmented Artificial Ecosystem Optimization-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (AAEO-MLP), to build a monthly groundwater level (GWL) forecasting model. AAEO-MLP model is built on the novel Augmented version of Artificial Ecosystem Optimization and traditional MLP network. In AAEO, Levy-flight trajectory and Gaussian random are utilized in exploration and exploitation to improve the optimizing ability. The AAEO-MLP model is tested on two time-series (1989–2012) datasets collected at two wells in India. Various explanatory variables such as monthly cumulative precipitation, mean temperature, tidal height, and previous measurements of GWL were considered for predicting 1-month ahead of GWL. The performance of AAEO-MLP was benchmarked against 17 different models (original AEO, 3 different variants of AEO, and 13 well-known models) in terms of forecasting accuracy based on six metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, root mean square error, Kling–Gupta efficiency, normalized Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, Pearson’s correlation index, a20 index). Furthermore, convergence analysis and model stability are employed to indicate the effectiveness of AAEO-MLP. The compared results express that the AAEO-MLP is superior to other models in terms of prediction accuracy, convergence, and stability. Overall, the results depict that the AAEO is a promising approach for optimizing machine learning models (e.g., MLP) and should be explored for other hydrological forecasting applications (e.g., streamflow, rainfall) to further assess its strengths over existing methods.},

   abstract = {Under a warmer climate, streamflow from the pan-Arctic River basins exhibits increasing trends in recent years. The higher streamflow would have a large impact on the atmospheric and oceanic circulation of the Arctic, even the globe. However, due to the limited observation data and the complex hydrologic processes in the polar river basins, it is challenging to simulate and to predict the streamflow under the impact of climate change. This study applied Support Vector Regression Model (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Multi-Variable Regression (MLR) model to simulate the monthly streamflow of four major pan-Arctic River basins: Mackenzie River basin, Ob’ River basin, Lena River basin, and Yenisei River basin. After validating the SVMs with datasets independent of the calibration experience, the SVMs were used to predict the monthly streamflow of the four large pan-Arctic river basins, under the climate projection scenarios, SSP245 and SSP585, of five CMIP6 GCMs: BCC-CSM2-MR, CAS-ESM2-0, CMCC-ESM2, FIO-ESM-2-0, and MPI-ESM1-2-HR, for 2020–2100. Results show that: 1) the precipitation and temperature are both projected to increase by almost five GCMs in almost river basins with larger amplitudes under SSP585 than SSP245; 2) with wetter and warmer climate, the annual streamflow was projected to increase continuously over the twenty-first century for Mackenzie, Lena, and Yenisei river significantly, with larger amplitudes under SSP585 than SSP245. The Ob’ river does not show significant increasing trends in its annual streamflow; 3) the higher annual streamflow of Lena and Yenisei river basins mainly come from the increase in summer streamflow, while for Meckanzie, the streamflow in summer and winter increases evenly. As its higher winter streamflow compenstates its lower summer streamflow, the annual streamflow of the Ob’ river is projected with minimal changes. In addition, the onset of spring snowmelt is also projected to occur earlier in all river basins due to warmer climate. Results of this study agree with previous findings that the Arctic streamflow is increasing, but this study also demonstrate different responses in seasonal streamflow between the river basins to warmer temperature and higher precipitation, which is largely controlled by the respectiver terrestrial environment of the river basins.},

Timely and reliable water footprints prediction is imperative and prerequisite to mitigating climate risk and enhancing water-use efficiency. This research adopts an Artificial Intelligence-Seasonal ARIMA (AI-SARIMA) integrated model to estimate, model, and forecast cassava's green and blue footprints (WFg and WFb) in Nanning city of Guangxi, China. Three supervised learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) and time series forecasting model: SARIMA model, are used in this study. The monthly meteorological data of minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), precipitation (P), sunshine hours (SH), wind speed (WS), and relative humidity (H) data from 1994 to 2019 are collected for modeling WFs by applying different scenarios of climate variables. The results show that the ANN method with hidden layers (8, 6) combined with input variables Tmax, Tmin, P, Kc, SH, and H was the best model to estimate WFb, the ANN with hidden layers (7, 5) combined with Tmax, Tmin, P, WS, and SH was the optimal estimation model for WFg. These WF estimation models achieve satisfying accuracy and coefficients of determination close to 1. Additionally, SARIMA models are integrated with the developed Artificial intelligence (AI) estimation model for WFs prediction. The results show that the WFs forecasting values can effectively match the overall trend of WFs. Thus, the AI-SARIMA coupled prediction models developed in this study are recom-mended for WFs estimation and prediction of energy crops in similar regions. Furthermore, this research can guide decision-making for water, agricultural, and biofuels managers and planners.},

Due to limited historical data for drought monitoring and forecasting available in the central India of Maharashtra state, implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms could allow for the prediction of future drought events. In this paper, we have focused on the prediction accuracy of meteorological drought in the semi-arid region based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI) using the random forest (RF), random tree (RT), and Gaussian process regression (GPR-PUK kernel) models. A different combination of machine learning models and variables has been performed for the forecasting of metrological drought based on the SPI-6 and 12 months. Models were developed using monthly rainfall data for the period of 2000-2019 at two meteorological stations, namely, Karanjali and Gangawdi, each representing a geographical region of Upper Godavari river basin area in the central India of Maharashtra state which frequently experiences droughts. Historical data from the SPI from 2000 to 2013 was processed to train the model into machine learning model, and the rest of the 2014 to 2019-year data were used for testing to forecast the SPI and metrological drought. The mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), adjusted R-2 , Mallows' (Cp), Akaike's (AIC), Schwarz's (SBC), and Amemiya's PC were used to identify the best combination input model and best subregression analysis for both stations of SPI-6 and 12. The correlation coefficient ( r ), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE) were used to perform evaluation for SPI-6 and 12 months of both stations with RF, RT, and GPR-PUK kernel models during the training and testing scenarios. The results during testing phase revealed that the RF was found as the best model in forecasting droughts with values of r , MAE, RMSE, RAE (%), and RRSE (%) being 0.856, 0.551, 0.718, 74.778, and 54.019, respectively, for SPI-6 while 0.961, 0.361, 0.538, 34.926, and 28.262, respectively, for SPI-12 scales at Gangawdi station. Further, the respective values of evaluators at Karanjali station were 0.913 and 0.966, 0.541 and 0.386, 0.604 and 0.589, 52.592 and 36.959, and 42.315 and 31.394 for PUK kernel and RT models, respectively, during SPI-6 and SPI-12. Machine learning models are potential drought warning techniques because they take less time, have fewer inputs, and are less sophisticated than dynamic or scientific models.},

   abstract = {Purpose Although soil total phosphorus (TP) is a primary and essential large element reflecting the soil fertility in agricultural ecosystems, studies on model development of TP and its differences between wheat and paddy lands after a long cultivation history at a regional scale are still limited. Hence, a comparison model of TP with different learning methods and datasets were built, and the relationship between environmental factors and TP were discussed. Methods TP from a long cultivation of either wheat or paddy agriculture systems was investigated, and the regression between TP and climate parameters (air temperatures, precipitation, humidity, and atmospheric pressure) and latitude were analyzed. A comparison of model development with six learning methods, including one statistical learning method (linear) and five machine learning methods (support vector regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM), and two datasets (0-20 and 0-170-cm soil layers) was made. The models were evaluated by the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean deviation (RMD), mean absolute error (MAE), and model effective (EF). Results The results showed that the TP content of the top soil layer in wheat lands (0.89 +/- 0.01 g kg(-1)) was significantly higher than that of paddy lands (0.63 +/- 0.01 g kg(-1)). The annual average precipitation, humidity, and air temperature had significant negative relationships with TP content, while the annual average atmospheric pressure and latitude had significant positive relationships with TP. Most machine learning methods showed better performances than that of a statistical learning method with the highest r(2) of 0.82. The different datasets used for model development had no significant effect on model performances. Conclusion The average TP content of the top soil layer tends to be greater in wheat lands than that in paddy lands after a long cultivation. Other than the different statistical parameters (the average, maximum, and minimum values) of each climate parameter, comprehensive climate parameters including the annual, semiannual, quarterly, and monthly air temperature, precipitation, humidity, and atmospheric pressure should be considered for further model development. Although different datasets in variable soil depth had no significant effect on model performances, machine learning methods such as random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM are recommended for better performance than a linear learning method for soil TP model development. It is recommended that a comparison of different machine learning methods will help build a stronger model in similar studies.},

In this study, we used machine learning (ML)-based prediction models, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Seasonal Auto- Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and Facebook Prophet (PROPHET) to predict 24 months ahead of natural streamflow at the Lees Ferry site located at the bottom part of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) of the US. Firstly, we used only historic streamflow data to predict 24 months ahead. Secondly, we considered meteorological components such as temperature and precipitation as additional features. We tested the models on a monthly test dataset spanning 6 years, where 24-month predictions were repeated 50 times to ensure the consistency of the results. Moreover, we performed a sensitivity analysis to identify our best-performing model. Later, we analyzed the effects of considering different span window sizes on the quality of predictions made by our best model. Finally, we applied our best-performing model, RFR, on two more rivers in different states in the UCRB to test the model's generalizability. We evaluated the performance of the predictive models using multiple evaluation measures. The predictions in multivariate time-series models were found to be more accurate, with RMSE less than 0.84 mm per month, R-squared more than 0.8, and MAPE less than 0.25. Therefore, we conclude that the temperature and precipitation of the UCRB increases the accuracy of the predictions. Ultimately, we found that multivariate RFR performs the best among four models and is generalizable to other rivers in the UCRB.},

   abstract = {Accurate forecasting of rainfall is extremely important due to its complex nature and enormous impacts on hydrology, floods, droughts, agriculture, and monitoring of pollutant concentration levels. In this study, a new multi-decomposition deep learning-based technique was proposed to forecast monthly rainfall in Himalayan region of India (i.e., Haridwar and Nainital). In the first stage, the original rainfall signals as the individual accessible datasets were decomposed into intrinsic mode decomposition functions (IMFs) through the time -varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD) technique, and then the significant lagged values were computed from the decomposed sub-sequences (i.e., IMFs) using the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). In the second stage, the PACF-based decomposed IMFs signals were again decomposed by the Singular Valued Decomposition (SVD) approach to reduce the dimensionality and enhance the forecasting accuracy. The machine learning approaches including the bidirectional long-short term memory reinforced with the Encoder -Decoder Bidirectional (EDBi-LSTM), Adaptive Boosting Regression (Adaboost), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Random Forest (RF) were used to construct the hybrid forecasting models. Also, several statistical metrics i.e., correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and graphical interpretation tools were employed to evaluate the hybrid (TVF-EMD-SVD-RF, TVF-EMD-SVD- EDBi-LSTM, TVF-EMD-SVD-Adaboost, and TVF-EMD-SVD-GRNN) and standalone counterpart (EDBi-LSTM, Adaboost, RF, and GRNN) models. The outcomes of monthly rainfall forecasting ascertain that the TVF-EMD-SVD-EDBi-LSTM in the Haridwar (R = 0.5870, RMSE = 118.4782 mm, and NSE = 0.3116) and Nainital (R = 0.9698, RMSE = 44.3963 mm, NSE = 0.9388) outperformed the benchmarking models.},

   abstract = {Assessment of spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables and their forecast is essential in the context of climate change. Such analysis can help suggest possible solutions for flora and fauna in protected areas and adaptation strategies to make forests and communities more resilient. The present study attempts to analyze climate variability, trend and forecast of temperature and rainfall in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve, India. We utilized rainfall and temperature gridded data obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department during 1981-2020. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were employed to examine the time series trend and magnitude of change at the annual, monthly and seasonal levels. Random forest machine learning algorithm was used to estimate seasonal prediction and forecasting of rainfall and temperature trend for the next ten years (2021-2030). The predictive capacity of the model was evaluated by statistical performance assessors of coefficient of correlation, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and root mean squared error. The findings revealed a significant decreasing trend in rainfall and an increasing trend in temperature. However, a declining trend for maximum temperature has been observed for winter and post-monsoon seasons. The results of seasonal forecasting exhibited a considerable decrease in rainfall and temperature across the Reserve during all the seasons. However, the temperature will increase during the summer season. The random forest machine learning algorithm has shown its effectiveness in forecasting the temperature and rainfall variables. The findings suggest that these approaches may be used at various spatial scales in different geographical locations.},

This study proposes an improved AI model, Augmented Artificial Ecosystem Optimization-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (AAEO-MLP), to build a monthly groundwater level (GWL) forecasting model. AAEO-MLP model is built on the novel Augmented version of Artificial Ecosystem Optimization and traditional MLP network. In AAEO, Levy -flight trajectory and Gaussian random are utilized in exploration and exploitation to improve the optimizing ability. The AAEO-MLP model is tested on two time-series (1989-2012) datasets collected at two wells in India. Various explanatory variables such as monthly cumulative precipitation, mean temperature, tidal height, and previous measurements of GWL were considered for predicting 1-month ahead of GWL. The performance of AAEO-MLP was benchmarked against 17 different models (original AEO, 3 different variants of AEO, and 13 well-known models) in terms of forecasting accuracy based on six metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, root mean square error, Kling-Gupta efficiency, normalized Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, Pearson's correlation index, a20 index). Furthermore, convergence analysis and model stability are employed to indicate the effectiveness of AAEO-MLP. The compared results express that the AAEO-MLP is superior to other models in terms of prediction accuracy, convergence, and stability. Overall, the results depict that the AAEO is a promising approach for optimizing machine learning models (e.g., MLP) and should be explored for other hydrological forecasting applications (e.g., streamflow, rainfall) to further assess its strengths over existing methods.},

   abstract = {Drought is one of the major global natural disasters, and appropriate monitoring systems are essential to reveal drought trends. In this regard, deep learning is a very promising approach for characterizing the non-linear nature of drought factors. We used multi-source remote sensing data such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data to integrate drought impact factors such as precipitation, vegetation, temperature, and soil moisture. The application of convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) to construct an integrated drought monitoring model was proposed and tested, using the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as an example. To better compare the monitoring performance of ConvLSTM models, three other classical deep learning models and three classical machine learning models were also used for comparison. The results show that the composite drought index (CDI) output by the ConvLSTM model had a consistent high correlation with the drought rating of the multi-scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The correlation coefficients between the CDI and the multi-scale standardized precipitation index (SPI) were all above 0.5 (p < 0.01), which was highly significant, and the correlation coefficient between CDI-1 and the monthly soil relative humidity at a 10 cm depth was above 0.45 (p < 0.01), which was well correlated. In addition, the spatial distribution of the CDI-6 simulated by the model was highly correlated with the degree of drought expressed by the SPEI-6 observations at the stations. This study provides a new approach for integrated regional drought monitoring.},

   abstract = {Accurate estimation of precipitation is critically important for a variety of fields, such as climatology, meteorology, and water resources. However, the availability of precipitation measurements has proved to be spatially inadequate for many applications. In this study, to acquire high-quality precipitation fields with enhanced accuracy and a fine-scale spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km, we developed a new data fusion method by establishing an energy function model using the downscaled Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (IMERG) precipitation product and high-density station observation in mainland China. Our merging approach was inspired by the interdisciplinary research framework integrating the methods in the fields of image processing, earth science, and machine learning. Cross-validation analyses were performed for the monthly precipitation over the period 2009-2018. It was found that the results of the newly developed method were more accurate than the original IMERG products in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (CC), and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE). The merging precipitation results exhibit consistent spatial patterns with the original IMERG products, yet have good agreement with station observations. The gauge observations were the major source of the prediction skill of precipitation for the proposed method, and the downscaled-IMERG precipitation products added additional spatial details in the final merging results. Results indicate that the proposed merging method can reproduce the spatial details of the precipitation fields as well as enhance their accuracy. In addition, the time evolution of the error index indicates that the improvement in the merged result was stable over time, with KGE improving by 14% on average. The developed approach provides a promising way of estimating precipitation with high spatial resolution and high accuracy, which will benefit hydrological and climatological studies.},

   abstract = {Every farmer requires access to rainfall prediction (RP) to continue their exploration of harvest yield. The proper use of water assets, the successful collection of water, and the successful pre-growth of water construction all depend on an accurate assessment of rainfall. The prediction of heavy rain and the provision of information regarding natural catastrophes are two of the most challenging factors in this regard. In the twentieth century, RP was the most methodically and technically complicated issue worldwide. Weather prediction may be used to calculate and analyse the behaviour of weather with unique features and to determine rainfall patterns at an exact locale. To this end, a variety of methodologies have been used to determine the rainfall intensity in Saudi Arabia. The classiﬁcation methods of data mining (DM) approaches that estimate rainfall both numerically and categorically can be used to achieve RP. This study, which used DM approaches, achieved greater accuracy in RP than conventional statistical methods. This study was conducted to test the efﬁcacy of several machine learning (ML) approaches for forecasting rainfall, utilising southern Saudi Arabia’s historical weather data obtained from the live database that comprises various meteorological data variables. Accurate crop yield predictions are crucial and would undoubtedly assist farmers. While engineers have developed analysis systems whose performance relies on several connected factors, these methods are seldom used despite their potential for precise crop yield forecasts. For this reason, agricultural forecasting should make use of these methods. The impact of drought on crop yield can be difﬁcult to forecast and there is a need for careful preparation regarding crop choice, planting window, harvest motive, and storage space. In this study, the relevant characteristics required to predict precipitation were identiﬁed and the ML approach utilised is an innovative classiﬁcation method that can be used determine whether the predicted rainfall will be regular or heavy. The outcomes of several different methodologies, including accuracy, error, recall, F-measure, RMSE, and MAE, are used to evaluate the performance metrics. Based on this evaluation, it is determined that DT provides the highest level of accuracy. The accuracy of the Function Fitting Artiﬁcial Neural Network classiﬁer (FFANN) is 96.1%, which is higher than that of any of the other classiﬁers currently used in the rainfall database.},

   abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET), as one of the most central parameters to the climate systems, plays a predominant role in the water, energy, carbon cycles, and energy-moisture exchanges between the earth and the atmosphere. Since the in-situ estimation of ET is challenging, the remote sensing-based techniques are deemed a reliable surrogate for the traditional ET estimation methods. The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission turned out to perform well in detecting the variations of ET over large basins. However, the subbasin-wise variations of ET based on the GRACE mission remain challenging due to its coarse resolution. In this study, the GRACE/GRACE-FO observations were downscaled based on Random Forest Machine Learning (RFML) algorithm and were integrated with fine-resolution precipitation and runoff data within the framework of the terrestrial water balance approach to derive small-scale variations of ET over Kizilirmak Basin (KB) in Turkiye. The results were compared to the fine-resolution ET products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite and Noah model and revealed acceptable precision of the methodology for the subbasin-wise application. The findings suggest that excluding the Lower Kizlirmak Basin (LKB), the water balance-based ET manifests a very high agreement with the MODIS- and Noah-derived ET over all the subbasins of the KB. The impacts of the main ET driving parameters such as temperature, water availability, solar radiation, surface albedo, and vegetation status were further investigated in terms of linear correlations. It is found that there is a high association between the monthly variations of ET and its conditioning factors over the KB, especially between the water availability and ET.},

   abstract = {Commercial plantation forestry is a vital industry worldwide, providing natural resources for humans and playing an important role in carbon sequestration. Historically, impacts of plantation development to natural resources such as surface and groundwater was not considered, however demand for water and drying climates has focussed attention on sustainable water use and extraction. The Lower Limestone Coast region of south-east South Australia has an extensive softwood plantation estate. The region is characterised by minimal surface water and substantial, fresh karstic groundwater resources, often <6 m below ground. Rapid expansion over shallow groundwater of the plantation hardwood estate from 2000, prompted concern about impacts of deep-rooted plantations on water resources and notably contracting wetlands. To quantify plantation estate water use, an extensive evapotranspiration (ET) field study (1999-2008) identified plantation areas with <6 m to groundwater as groundwater users, leading to water policy whereby plantations are considered licenced water users. To enable plantation expansion in the region, fine resolution, broadscale ET data is required to ensure optimum use of water licences in the forest industry and account for plantation groundwater extraction. As continual field studies are not feasible, this 20-year, monthly 30 m ET dataset for the region was developed to improve estimates of plantation water use, enabling improved, dynamic estimates of groundwater extraction. The dataset was developed using 21 long-term field sites where ET was derived based on field measured transpiration, soil moisture, canopy interaction and rainfall data. Region specific field ET was combined with machine learning and additional remote sensing layers to estimate monthly ET (R-2 = 0.86) across the plantation estate, improving on a national remote sensing ET product. Currently, groundwater extraction is accounted for via modelling which excludes dynamic changes in plantation groundwater extraction, limiting understanding of the hydrological processes influencing available water resources and potentially impeding economic growth.},

   abstract = {Meteorological drivers of groundwater recharge for spring (February-June), fall (October-January), and recharge-year (October-June) recharge seasons were evaluated for northern New England and upstate New York from 1989 to 2018. Monthly groundwater recharge was computed at 21 observation wells by subtracting the water levels at the end of each month from the level of the previous month; only positive monthly values were used to compute seasonal recharge. Precipitation, temperature, sea-level pressure, 500-mb geopotential heights, and various teleconnection indices were tested as explanatory variables for the interannual variability of recharge using random forest machine learning models. Precipitation within recharge seasons was positively correlated with groundwater recharge for most wells in all seasons. In general, whilst groundwater recharge in the study area was generally highest during the months of March and April, October precipitation was an important month for explaining the interannual groundwater recharge variability. This is likely because the variability in recharge in October may be high or low for given years. Sea-level pressure and 500-mb heights were typically inversely correlated with groundwater recharge during the recharge-year and fall recharge seasons, as higher sea-level pressure and heights are usually associated with clearer skies and less precipitation. The North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific-North American pattern, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation teleconnections affected groundwater recharge differently by well and season. The influence of groundwater recharge on minimum daily streamflows during the subsequent summer/fall was also analysed. Summer precipitation was the most important explanatory variable for study streams whilst groundwater recharge and summer air temperature were significant variables for a few streams.},

   abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.},

However, because of its nonlinearity, prediction of daily rainfall with high accuracy and long prediction lead time is difficult. There are many daily rainfall prediction methods in the literature, but they are known to yield inaccurate predictions with short lead time, require many physical parameters and involve complicated mathematical equations with huge computational burden. Recently, artificial neural network has been used for predicting rainfall with the objective of addressing the above mentioned problems. But still, the accuracy has not been satisfactory and predictions are with short lead time. In this study, two methods called combined season-multilayer perceptron (SAS-MP) and hybrid wavelet-season-multilayer perceptron (W-SAS-MP) were developed to enhance prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead time of daily rainfall up to 5days by using data from two stations in Turkey. These two models were compared with the stand-alone multilayer perceptron and another most commonly used method called combined wavelet-multilayer perceptron (W-MP). The performances of the models were evaluated by using coefficient of determination, coefficient of efficiency and root mean squared error. The SAS-MP model was found to be better than W-MP in most cases, except lead time day 1, where W-MP performed better. Throughout all the lead times, however, the hybrid W-SAS-MP model performed best with CE values of 0.911 and 0.909, respectively, for prediction lead time of 1day and 0.588 and 0.570, respectively, for prediction lead time of 5days at Stations 17836 and 17837, respectively, at the model testing (validation) phase. Therefore, W-SAS-MP can be an appropriate tool for enhancing daily rainfall prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead time.},

In this paper, a novel approach is adopted to develop a hybrid regression model for 1-month-ahead rainfall forecasting at two rain gauge locations (namely: Tabriz and Urmia stations), in northwest Iran. The approach is based on the integration of support vector regression (SVR) and firefly algorithm (FFA) that results in truthful rainfall forecasts. The proposed hybrid model was trained and validated using weak stationary state of monthly rainfall data obtained from the gauges. The efficiency results of the model were also cross-validated with those of stand-alone SVR- and genetic programming-based forecasting models developed as the benchmarks in this study. For both rain gauge locations, the results showed that the hybrid model significantly outperforms the benchmarks. With respect to the average efficiency results at the gauge locations, the FFA-induced improvement in the SVR forecasts was matched by an approximately 30% decrease in root-mean-square error and around 100% increase in Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency. Such a promising accuracy in the proposed model may recommend its application at monthly rainfall forecasting in the present semiarid region.},

   abstract = {A more accurate and timely rainfall prediction is needed for flood disaster reduction and prevention in Wuhan. The in situ microelectromechanical systems’ (MEMS) sensors can provide high time and spatial resolution of weather parameter measurement, but they suffer from stochastic measurement error. In order to apply MEMS sensors in real-time rainfall prediction in Wuhan, firstly, seasonal trend decomposition using Loess (STL) algorithm is utilized to decompose the observed time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components. The trend of the observed series is compared with the corresponding trend of the data downloaded from the authoritative website with the same weather parameter in terms of Euclidean distance and cosine similarity. The similarity demonstrates that the observation of MEMS sensors is believable. Secondly, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to predict the real-time rainfall based on the observed data. Compared with autoregressive and moving average (ARMA), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back propagation neural networks (BPNNs), LSTM not only performs as well as ARMA in real-time rainfall prediction but also outperforms the other four models in seasonal rainfall pattern description and seasonal real-time rainfall prediction. Our experiment results show that more detailed, timely, and accurate rainfall prediction can be achieved by using LSTM on the MEMS weather sensors.},

   abstract = {Forecasting the monsoon temporally is a major scientific issue in the field of monsoon meteorology. The ensemble of statistics and mathematics has increased the accuracy of forecasting of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) up to some extent. But due to the nonlinear nature of ISMR, its forecasting accuracy is still below the satisfactory level. Mathematical and statistical models require complex computing power. Therefore, many researchers have paid attention to apply artificial neural network in ISMR forecasting. In this study, we have used feed-forward back-propagation neural network algorithm for ISMR forecasting. Based on this algorithm, we have proposed the five neural network architectures designated as BP1, BP2, $$\ldots, $$BP5 using three layers of neurons (one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer). Detail architecture of the neural networks is provided in this article. Time series data set of ISMR is obtained from Pathasarathy et al. (Theor Appl Climatol 49:217–224 1994) (1871–1994) and IITM (http://www.tropmet.res.in/, 2012) (1995–2010) for the period 1871–2010, for the months of June, July, August and September individually, and for the monsoon season (sum of June, July, August and September). The data set is trained and tested separately for each of the neural network architecture, viz., BP1–BP5. The forecasted results obtained for the training and testing data are then compared with existing model. Results clearly exhibit superiority of our model over the considered existing model. The seasonal rainfall values over India for next 5 years have also been predicted.},

Climate change effects on PMP are analyzed, in particular, maximization of moisture and persistent upward motion, using both climate model simulations and conceptual models of relevant meteorological systems. Climate model simulations indicate a substantial future increase in mean and maximum water vapor concentrations. For the RCP8.5 scenario, the changes in maximum values for the continental United States are approximately 20%–30% by 2071–2100. The magnitudes of the maximum water vapor changes follow temperature changes with an approximate Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Model-simulated changes in maximum vertical and horizontal winds are too small to offset water vapor changes. Thus, our conclusion is that the most scientifically sound projection is that PMP values will increase in the future due to higher levels of atmospheric moisture content and consequent higher levels of moisture transport into storms.},

Despite the advances reported in climate modelling, it remains a challenge to adequately develop approaches for impact assessment that can be easily interpreted by a wide range of decision makers in the society. The future scenarios are customarily projected with a range of uncertainties. Based on a case study, this article first discusses the complementarity of different statistical tools that are relevant for assessing the impact of climate change. Then, it reports a probabilistic method, which shows promising applicability. Specifically, we address the effect of climate change over the entire range of monthly precipitation and the number of precipitation events (>3 mm) across the Texas Gulf watershed. We consider daily precipitation series released by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program for historical (1971–2000) and future (2041–2070) periods. The precipitation series are bias-corrected and are then analysed using different statistical methods, including trends and pooled analyses. Subsequently, we present a probabilistic approach that is capable of depicting the plausible effects of climate change in time and space. Finally, we infer temporal changes in seasonal precipitation across the watershed, which suggest meaningful spatial disparity. The probabilistic approach may serve as a complementary tool that seems to be relevant for a holistic interpretation of critical changes in precipitation patterns under climate change.},

@article{Trenberth2011,
   abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1°C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: ‘it never rains but it pours!’ This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the ‘rich get richer and the poor get poorer’. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. ‘more bang for the buck’, atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Niño a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

   abstract = {Precipitation affects the generation of runoff and concentration of water resources in basins. The randomness of precipitation contributes to the difficulty and uncertainty of forecasting it. To improve precipitation forecasting accuracy and account for this uncertainty, a new scheme for probabilistic precipitation forecasting is proposed. In the scheme, first, signal decomposition techniques (complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise) are used to decompose original precipitation series into subsequences. Second, empirical approaches (time series analysis model, grey self-memory model and long-short-term memory) are used to produce a quantitative precipitation forecast. Third, an ensemble model is used to assemble the outputs of empirical approaches, whose weights are determined by the Adaptive Metropolis-Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (AM-MCMC). The AM-MCMC is adopted to produce a large number of weights for single models in an ensemble model. The quantitative forecasting (prediction) and its confidence interval at a given probability (90%) are obtained by multiplying the single-model predictions by the mean and the confidence interval of the weights assigned to those predictions, respectively. In this study, the annual precipitation (single annual value of each year) is adopted to test the performance of the new scheme. The precipitation of the forecast year is obtained from the precipitation forecast of the previous p years (p is the autocorrelation order of annual precipitation series). The results show that the new scheme for probabilistic forecasting for precipitation has better forecasting accuracy than single-model predictions; the RMSE is less than 139, and the MARE is less than 8.99%. Moreover, the new scheme for probabilistic forecasting for precipitation gets great probabilistic metrics, the CRPS ranges from 0.009 to 0.036, the reliability ranges from 0.001 to 0.008, and sharpness ranges from 24 to 77.},

Considering the periodicity and variability of traffic flow and limitations of single prediction models, an adaptive hybrid model for predicting short-term traffic flow was proposed in this study. Firstly, the linear Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and non-linear Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) method were used to predict traffic flow. Then, outputs of the two individual models were analyzed and combined by fuzzy logic and the weighted result was regarded as the final predicted traffic volume of the hybrid model. The results indicate that the hybrid model can offer better performance in predicting short-term traffic flow than the two single models either in stable or in fluctuating conditions. The relative error is within ±10%, showing that the proposed hybrid model is both accurate and reliable.},

   abstract = {It has become increasingly difficult in recent years to predict precipitation scientifically and accurately due to the dual effects of human activities and climatic conditions. This paper focuses on four aspects to improve precipitation prediction accuracy. Five decomposition methods (time-varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD), robust empirical mode decomposition (REMD), complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), wavelet transform (WT), and extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) combined with the Elman neural network (ENN)) are used to construct five prediction models, i.e., TVF-EMD-ENN, REMD-ENN, CEEMD-ENN, WT-ENN, and ESMD-ENN. The variance contribution rate (VCR) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) are utilized to compare the performances of the five decomposition methods. The wavelet transform coherence (WTC) is used to determine the reason for the poor prediction performance of machine learning algorithms in individual years and the relationship with climate indicators. A secondary decomposition of the TVF-EMD is used to improve the prediction accuracy of the models. The proposed methods are used to predict the annual precipitation in Guangzhou. The subcomponents obtained from the TVF-EMD are the most stable among the four decomposition methods, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the Nino 3.4 index, and sunspots have a smaller influence on the first subcomponent (Sc-1) than the other subcomponents. The TVF-EMD-ENN model has the best prediction performance and outperforms traditional machine learning models. The secondary decomposition of the Sc-1 of the TVF-EMD model significantly improves the prediction accuracy.},

Rainfall forecasting is difficult due to the ever-changing nature of weather conditions. In this study, we carry out a rainfall predictive model for Jimma, a region located in southwestern Oromia, Ethiopia. We propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based prediction model capable of forecasting Jimma's daily rainfall. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed models using various metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), and R2, and the results were 0.01, 0.4786, 0.81 and 0.9972, respectively. We also compared the proposed model with existing machine-learning regressions like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). The RMSE of MLP was the lowest of the four existing learning models i.e., 0.03. The proposed LSTM model outperforms the existing models, with an RMSE of 0.01. The experimental results show that the proposed model has a lower RMSE and a higher R2.},

While there is consensus in the literature that cross-validation (CV) should be used for model selection in this context, the interdisciplinary nature of the subject has made it hard to reach consensus over which metrics to use at each stage of the CV exercise. We collect 48 metrics (from the AVM literature and elsewhere) and classify them into seven groups according to their structure. Each of these groups focuses on a particular aspect of the error distribution. Depending on the type of data and the purpose of the AVM, the needs of users may be met by some classes, but not by others. In addition, we show in an empirical application how the choice of metric can influence the choice of model, by applying each metric to evaluate five commonly used AVM models. Finally – since it is not always practicable to produce 48 different performance metrics – we provide a short list of 7 metrics that are well suited to evaluate AVMs. These metrics satisfy a symmetry condition that we find is important for AVM performance, and can provide a good overall model performance ranking.},

A particular objective is to investigate and analyzed the methods used to forecast energy, real time use in multiple applications and to identify the research review with useful techniques that are approachable in the current literature. This review contains a critical comparison and study among various modeling techniques to choose a better forecasting model for performing the desired task in multiple applications. The forecasting accuracy is compared and analyzed through comprehensive literature review and with the real-time energy consumption and climate data used for modeling analysis. The Bayesian regularization backpropagation neural networks (BRBNNs) and the Levenberg Marquardt backpropagation neural networks (LMBNNs) render higher forecasting accuracy and performance with the coefficient of correlation 0.972 and 0.971 respectively. The supervised learning is useful for real-time applications because of optimal scenario of a specific model will allow for the model to precisely predict the label’s class for unseen data instances. Additionally, the supervised learning can reduce the noise and control imbalanced data in the network formulation.},

   abstract = {Future changes in precipitation have significant social implications, as these are predicted to have profound impacts on disaster prevention and the environment at global and regional scales. The climate change impacts on precipitation can be divided into changes in “form” and “amount/frequency.” Changes in form have a higher likelihood of occurring at mid- to high-latitudes where the region of the atmospheric layer has surface temperatures close to 0°C (the rain–snow transition layer). For the latter, the intensity of extreme precipitation events is projected to increase throughout most parts of the world under climate change. While there are still significant uncertainties and resolution issues regarding regional scale projections, the use of climate model simulations could be useful in considering climate change adaptation options. To understand future precipitation change, weather pattern classification using the self-organizing map technique is introduced. This can be an effective tool to analyze the attribution of global warming impacts, which can differ among weather events, and has the potential to improve the climate change impact assessment interpretability. This approach also facilitates to separate the climate change impacts into dynamic and thermodynamic effects.},

Based on the advantages that complementary ensemble empirical modal decomposition (CEEMD) can effectively overcome modal aliasing, white noise interference, and the ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to handle problems such as gradient disappearance. A CEEMD–LSTM coupled long-term and short-term memory network model was developed and adopted for monthly precipitation prediction of Zhengzhou City. The performance shows that the CEEMD–LSTM model has a mean absolute error of 0.056, a root mean square error of 0.153, a mean relative error of 2.73% and a Nash efﬁciency coefﬁcient of 0.95, which is better than the CEEMD–Back Propagation (BP) neural network model, the LSTM model and the BP model in terms of prediction accuracies. This demonstrates its powerful nonlinear and complex process learning capability in hydrological factor simulation for regional precipitation prediction.},

To solve the mode mixing problem, a noise‐assisted data analysis method called ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is adopted instead of EMD. In this paper, the applications of EMD and EEMD on time–frequency analyzing behaviors were compared, and the results show that (1) EMD decomposes an original nonlinear and non-stationary signal into a series of simple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), but with the mode mixing phenomenon. (2) EEMD skillfully solves the mode mixing problem by adding a white noise to the original signal. (3) The synthetic signal example reveals the remarkable ability of EEMD to decompose the signal into different IMFs and analyze the time–frequency distribution of the signal.

   abstract = {In this article, a rainfall forecasting model using monthly historical rainfall data and climate indices is developed by incorporating the multi-resolution analysis (MRA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The monthly rainfall anomaly and large-scale climate index time series are decomposed using MRA into a certain number of component subseries at different temporal scales. The hierarchical lag relationship between the rainfall anomaly and each potential predictor is identiﬁed by cross correlation analysis with a lag time of at least one month at different temporal scales. The components of predictor variables with known lag times are then screened with a stepwise linear regression algorithm to be selectively included into the ﬁnal forecast model. This MRA-based rainfall forecasting method is examined with 46 stations over South Australia, and compared to the traditional MLR model based on the original time series. The models are trained with data from the 1959–1995 period and then tested in the 1996–2008 period for each station. The performance is compared with observed rainfall values, and evaluated by common statistics of relative absolute error and correlation coefﬁcient. The results show that the proposed MRA-based model provides considerably more accurate monthly rainfall forecasts for all of the selected stations over South Australia than the traditional regression model. For the MRA-based method, historical rainfall is consistently useful for all examined stations, while the large-scale climate signals are only partly useful for some stations.},

Herein, two diﬀerent scenarios, scenario1 (SC1) and scenario2 (SC2), were investigated, with each scenario comprising a diﬀerent combination of input parameters. This study proposes two artiﬁcial intelligence techniques: a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Furthermore, three evaluation indexes were adopted to assess the performance of the proposed models. These indexes are the correlation coeﬃcient, root mean square error, and scatter index. The trial and error method were used to tune the hyperparameters: the number of neurons in the hidden layer, training algorithms, transfer and activation functions, and number and shape of the membership function for the proposed models. Results show that for the above mentioned three stations, the ANFIS model outperformed MLP-ANN by 0.740%, 6.23%, and 9.39%, respectively. To assess the uncertainties of the best model, ANFIS, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPUs) and the band width of 95 percent conﬁdence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPUs are show about 75.2%, 77.4%, 76.8% and the d-factor has a value of 0.27, 0.21 and 0.23 at Kudat, Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu stations, respectively.

   abstract = {Recent heavy rainfall-induced flood events, for example in Germany, Australia and USA, have highlighted the relevance of countermeasures in saving human lives and preventing property damage. Newly introduced ML-based flood forecasting methods rely on high-intensity synthetic rainfall events due to the sparsity of their real counterpart. Such synthetic data instances can be produced by precipitation generators trained in an adversarial setting on historical rainfall data. Capturing processes for rainfall data are often highly distributed, with multiple radar stations contributing to a centralised data set. However, data centralisation entails challenges regarding data-stream logistics, data locality, and memory overhead. Distributed Analytics (DA) aims to overcome these challenges through decentralised model training by bringing the algorithm to the data instead of vice versa. In this work, we propose a feasibility study evaluating the applicability of DA on hydrological data. As example of use, we choose the decentralised training of rainfall data generators. We introduce a rainfall generator training procedure relying on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and evaluate two DA algorithms: Federated Learning (FL) and Cyclic Institutional Incremental Learning (CIIL). We compare the resulting training outcomes with the centralised model training (CL) approach and find CIIL performed similarly to CL but less stable, while FL outperformed CL by 7.5%. We conclude that the proven feasibility of FL in our simulated distributed setting lays the groundwork for utilising this approach in realistic environments of grander scale while overcoming potential privacy concerns or logistical challenges in the setting of centralised analytics.},

Obtaining accurate and high-resolution air temperature data has been a persistent challenge in research. This study selected the Yellow River Basin as its research area and assessed multiple variables, including the land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, aspect, longitude, and latitude. We constructed three downscaling models, namely, ET, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and applied a stacking ensemble learning algorithm to integrate these three models. Through this approach, ERA5-Land reanalysis air temperature data were successfully downscaled from a spatial resolution of 0.1◦ to 1 km, and the downscaled results were validated using observed data from meteorological stations. The results indicate that the stacking ensemble model significantly outperforms the three independent machine learning models. The integrated model, combined with the selected set of multiple variables, provides a feasible approach for downsizing ERA5 air temperature data. The stacking ensemble model not only effectively enhances the spatial resolution of ERA5 reanalysis air temperature data but also improves downscaled results to a certain extent. The downscaled air temperature data exhibit richer spatial texture information, better revealing spatial variations in air temperature within the same land class. This research outcome provides robust technical support for obtaining high-resolution air temperature data in meteorologically sparse or topographically complex regions, contributing significantly to climate, ecosystem, and sustainable development research.},

From a statistical perspective, this presents a high- dimensional, highly underdetermined problem. Recent advances in machine learning provide methods for learning such probability distributions. We test the usage of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for estimating the full probability distribution of spatial rainfall patterns with high temporal resolution, conditioned on a ﬁeld of lower temporal resolution. The GAN is trained on rainfall radar data with hourly resolution. Given a new ﬁeld of daily precipitation sums, it can sample scenarios of spatiotemporal patterns with sub-daily resolution. While the generated patterns do not perfectly reproduce the statistics of observations, they are visually hardly distinguishable from real patterns. Limitations that we found are that providing additional input (such as geographical information) to the GAN surprisingly leads to worse results, showing that it is not trivial to increase the amount of used input information. Additionally, while in principle the GAN should learn the probability distribution in itself, we still needed expert judgment to determine at which point the training should stop, because longer training leads to worse results.},

Within the BN architecture, two heuristic algorithms namely Hill-Climb (HC) and Max-Min Hill Climb (MMHC) were used to establish that a large part (89% for HC and 97% for MMHC) of the input information was redundant, given the potential predictors that are selected via these algorithms. The potential predictors revealed via these algorithms include geo-potential height at a pressure of 850 mb, total precipitable water, and soil moisture, each at a lead time of 2 months. The selected predictors were further used to develop a prediction model that results in good agreement with the observations. Additionally, two widely used machine learning techniques namely, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were also used to develop standalone models wherein all the 72 probable predictors are used for prediction, and also in conjunction with BN (i.e., BN-ANN and BN-SVR), wherein only the drivers selected via BN are used as predictors. The results indicate that the parsimonious models perform better or equally well as the higher dimensional models, with refined Index of agreement values: MDBN = 0.824, MDBN-ANN = 0.835 and MDBN-SVR = 0.841, MDANN = 0.813, MDSVR = 0.823, and Normalized Mean Square Error values: NMSEBN = 0.242, NMSEBN-ANN = 0.226 and NMSEBN-SVR = 0.234, NMSEANN = 0.226, NMSESVR = 0.238 for validation period (averaged values across three folds). The model predictions are further used to categorize monthly rainfall into dry/ intermediate/ wet in terms of Standardized Precipitation Anomaly Index (SPAI). All the approaches show consistent performance, with the ‘dry’ cases being captured slightly better than ‘wet’ cases.},

   abstract = {Statistical models were developed for downscaling reanalysis data to monthly precipitation at 48 observation stations scattered across the Australian State of Victoria belonging to wet, intermediate and dry climate regimes. Downscaling models were calibrated over the period 1950–1991 and validated over the period 1992–2014 for each calendar month, for each station, using 4 machine learning techniques, (1) Genetic Programming (GP), (2) Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs), (3) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (4) Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). It was found that, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, downscaling models tend to better simulate the average (compared to other statistics) and under-estimate the standard deviation and the maximum of the observed precipitation. Also, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, at the majority of stations downscaling models showed an over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles (i.e. below the 50th percentile) of precipitation and under-estimating trend of high percentiles of precipitation (i.e. above the 90th percentile). The over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles of precipitation was more pronounced at stations located in dryer climate, irrespective of the machine learning technique. Based on the results of this investigation the use of RVM or ANN over SVM or GP for developing downscaling models can be recommended for a study such as ﬂood prediction which involves the consideration of high extremes of precipitation. Also, RVM can be recommended over GP, ANN or SVM in developing downscaling models for a study such as drought analysis which involves the consideration of low extremes of precipitation. Furthermore, it was found that irrespective of the climate regime, the SVM and RVM-based precipitation downscaling models showed the best performance with the Polynomial kernel.},

   abstract = {Satellites with microwave-based sensors are launched to study and estimate global precipitation due to the instrument’s sensitivity to precipitation, as well as their global coverage. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) mission jointly launched by NASA of US and JAXA of Japan to study the global rain within the tropics had two microwave-based instruments on board; the Precipitation Radar (PR) and the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI). Radar, being an active in­ strument, measures rainfall by detecting the echo accurately over both land and oceans. On the other hand, the passive instrument, radiometer, senses radiation emerging from the land/ocean surface, passing through the raining atmosphere. Due to the absence of contrast over land pixels, radiometers do not perform well over land surfaces in the detection of rainfall. Hence, over land rain screening algorithms are predominantly based on high-frequency channels which are sen­ sitive to the scattering of radiation. However, their performance in screening the pixel for rain is based on threshold values. The present study demonstrates a superior algorithm powered by machine learning (ML) techniques. We apply the artificial neural network (ANN) and the random forest algorithm for screening the pixels over land for rainfall. The algorithms are trained with TMI measured brightness temperatures, while the TRMM PR detected rain flag is used as the truth. The ML models were trained with 2012 JJAS data over the Indian landmass. The perfor­ mance of the ML models is tested with the monthly data of 2012 and with the 2013 JJAS dataset over the same region to demonstrate the robustness of the model. The imbalance of the dataset (a small fraction of rain cases as compared to no-rain cases) has been addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A comparison is made between the two ML algo­ rithms against the GPROF algorithm, which is implemented in the operational data product for the TRMM version 7 data product. Results show that the ML-based methods performed better as compared to the GPROF. On the 2013 JJAS dataset, the maximum F1 score obtained was 0.65 for the actual dataset, while the score with oversampled dataset was 0.68. For the same dataset, the GPROF algorithm showed an F1 score of 0.59. Apart from the nine brightness temperatures as input, new derived features were also selected based on two feature selection methods: mutual information and analysis of variance. It was seen that the models’ performance on the two feature sets obtained from the two methods were very much similar.},

This study aims to evaluate five downscaling methods to determine the accuracy and efficiency of which on generating high-resolution precipitation data at annual and monthly scales. To establish precipitation-Land surface characteristics relationship, environmental factors, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM), were considered as proxies in the spatial downscaling procedure. The downscaling algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), geographically weighted regression (GWR), multiple linear regression (MLR) and exponential regression (ER), were implemented to downscale the version 7 of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation (3B43 V7 product) over Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) from 0.25◦ to 1 km spatial resolution. The downscaled precipitation data was validated against observations from meteorological stations. Monthly fractions derived from TRMM 3B43 were used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation. Furthermore, the best method was selected for calibration based on Geographical Dif­ ference Analysis (GDA) to assess the effectiveness of the calibration as a viable option. The results indicate that SVM not only outperforms the other methods, but also has good agreements with in-situ measurements compared to the original TRMM. The results confirm that inclusion of LST and geographic information along with NDVI can improve the downscaling performance. Downscaling and GDA calibration significantly improve the accuracy of TRMM 3B43 product at both spatial and temporal resolution and should be considered as an essential step in calibration of TRMM precipitation. Calibration at monthly scale yields slightly better results than calibration at annual scale and then disaggregating into monthly maps in terms of accuracy assessment.},

The near-term prediction (e.g., 10 years) of hydrologic data is a recent development in GCM (General Circulation Model) simulations, e.g., the CMIP5 (Coupled Modelled Intercomparison Project Phase 5) decadal experiments. The prediction of monthly rainfall on a decadal time scale is an important step for catchment management. Previous studies have considered stochastic models using observed time series data only for rainfall prediction, but no studies have used GCM decadal data together with observed data at the catchment level. This study used the Facebook Prophet (FBP) model and six machine learning (ML) regression algorithms for the prediction of monthly rainfall on a decadal time scale for the Brisbane River catchment in Queensland, Australia. Monthly hindcast decadal precipitation data of eight GCMs (EC-EARTH MIROC4h, MRI-CGCM3, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MIROC5, CanCM4, and CMCC-CM) were downloaded from the CMIP5 data portal, and the observed data were collected from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. At ﬁrst, the FBP model was used for predictions based on: (i) the observed data only; and (ii) a combination of observed and CMIP5 decadal data. In the next step, predictions were performed through ML regressions where CMIP5 decadal data were used as features and corresponding observed data were used as target variables. The prediction skills were assessed through several skill tests, including Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient (PCC), Anomaly Correlation Coefﬁcient (ACC), Index of Agreement (IA), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Upon comparing the skills, this study found that predictions based on a combination of observed and CMIP5 decadal data through the FBP model provided better skills than the predictions based on the observed data only. The optimal performance of the FBP model, especially for the dry periods, was mainly due to its multiplicative seasonality function.},

   abstract = {Changes in patterns of meteorological parameters, like precipitations, temperature, wind, etc., are causing significant increases in various extreme events. And these extreme events, i.e., floods, heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, etc., lead to a shortage of water resources, crop failures, wildfires, and economic losses. However, Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are considered the most important tools for quantifying climate change. Therefore, we selected 20 different GCMs of precipitation in our research, as the frequency of extreme events, like drought and flood, is highly related to changes in precipitation patterns. However, this research introduced a new weighting scheme — MCFSAWS-Ensemble: Monte Carlo Feature Selection Adaptive Weighting Scheme to Ensemble multiple GCMs, whereas, Monte Carlo Feature Selection (MCFS) is one of the most popular algorithms for discovering important variables. However, the proposed weighting scheme (MCFSAWS-Ensemble) is mainly based on two sources. Initially, it evaluates the prior performance of each GCM model to define their relative importance using MCFS. Then, it computes value by value difference between the observed and simulated model. In addition, the application of this paper is based on the monthly time series data of precipitation in the Tibet Plateau region of China. In addition, we used twenty GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to analyze the implications of the MCFSAWS-Ensemble. Further, we compared the performance of the MCFSAWS-Ensemble scheme with Simple Model Averaging (SMA) through Mean Average Error (MAE) and correlation statistics. The results of this research indicate that the proposed weighting scheme (MCFSAWS-Ensemble) is more accurate than the SMA approach. Consequently, we recommend the use of advanced machine learning algorithms such as MCFS for making accurate multi-model ensembles.},

Numerical experiments using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) were conducted over South Korea with lateral boundary conditions of ERA5 reanalysis data. For the spatial distribution of mean summertime rainfall, the bias-uncorrected WRF simulation (WRF_RAW) showed dry bias for most of the region of South Korea. The WRF results corrected by QM and LSTM (WRF_QM and WRF_LSTM, respectively) were improved for the mean summer rainfall simulation with the root mean square error values of 0.17 and 0.69, respectively, which were smaller than those of the WRF_RAW (1.10). Although the WRF_QM performed better than the WRF_LSTM in terms of the summertime mean and monthly precipitation, the WRF_LSTM presented a closer interannual rainfall variation to the observation than the WRF_QM. The coefﬁcient of determination for calendar-day mean rainfall was the highest in the following order: the WRF_LSTM (0.451), WRF_QM (0.230), and WRF_RAW (0.201). However, the WRF_LSTM had a limitation in reproducing extreme rainfall exceeding 50 mm/day due to the few cases of extreme precipitation in training data. Nevertheless, the WRF_LSTM better simulated the observed light-to-moderate precipitation (10–50 mm/day) than the others.},

As a first step we train the CGP over the 1985–2005 period, and then apply it out of sample from 2006 to 2019. Over the validation period, our results indicate that the CGP is able to increase the skill (i.e., increased correlation coefficient and reduced root mean squared error) in predicting precipitation and temperature compared to both the raw outputs and after standard bias correction. These statements are consistent across different lead times and target month (i.e., March or July). These encouraging findings provide a new potential path towards improved predictability of the regional climate at the seasonal scale.},

Speciﬁcally, a high-quality grid-point ﬁeld is created by fusing and revising the precipitation data from multiple sources. This ﬁeld is combined with the Empirical Orthogonal Function decomposition and the causal information ﬂow. Next, the best predictors are screened through Empirical Orthogonal Function decomposition and causal information ﬂow, and a data-driven precipitation prediction model is established using a Back Propagation Neural Network and a Random Forest algorithm to conduct the 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month precipitation predictions. The results show that: The machine learning-based precipitation prediction model has high accuracy and is generally able to predict the precipitation trend in the western region better. The Random Forest algorithm signiﬁcantly outperforms the Back Propagation Neural Network algorithm in the prediction of the three starting times, and the prediction ability of both models gradually decreases as the starting time increases. Compared with the 2022 ﬂood season prediction scores of the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the model improves the prediction of 1-month and 3-month precipitation in the western region and provides a new idea for the short-term climate prediction of precipitation in western China.},

In developing the machine learning model, 70% of the dataset was used for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation.

To train the proposed ANN an RF models, the ERA5 reanalysis dataset is employed. To compare the performance of the proposed algorithms, four performance evaluation criteria are calculated for each model. The results indicate that the performance of the ANN and RF post-processing is better than that of the individual NMME models. Moreover, RF outperformed ANN for all lead times and months of the year.},

In this context, satellite precipitation and topography data are the predictor variables, and gauged-measured precipitation data are the dependent variables. Alongside this, it is increasingly recognised in many ﬁelds that combinations of algorithms through ensemble learning can lead to substantial predictive performance improvements. Still, a sufﬁcient number of ensemble learners for improving the accuracy of satellite precipitation products and their large-scale comparison are currently missing from the literature. In this study, we work towards ﬁlling in this speciﬁc gap by proposing 11 new ensemble learners in the ﬁeld and by extensively comparing them. We apply the ensemble learners to monthly data from the PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artiﬁcial Neural Networks) and IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) gridded datasets that span over a 15-year period and over the entire contiguous United States (CONUS). We also use gauge-measured precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network monthly database, version 2 (GHCNm). The ensemble learners combine the predictions of six machine learning regression algorithms (base learners), namely the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), multivariate adaptive polynomial splines (poly-MARS), random forests (RF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNN), and each of them is based on a different combiner. The combiners include the equal-weight combiner, the median combiner, two best learners and seven variants of a sophisticated stacking method. The latter stacks a regression algorithm on top of the base learners to combine their independent predictions. Its seven variants are deﬁned by seven different regression algorithms, speciﬁcally the linear regression (LR) algorithm and the six algorithms also used as base learners. The results suggest that sophisticated stacking performs signiﬁcantly better than the base learners, especially when applied using the LR algorithm. It also beats the simpler combination methods.},

The research results show that the sum of annual precipitation predicted by the CEEMD-ELM-FFOA model is 577.33 mm, which is higher than the measured value of 572.53 mm with an error of 4.80 mm. The average absolute error is 0.81 and the average relative error is 1.39%. The prediction value of the CEEMD-ELM-FFOA model can closely follow the changing trend of precipitation, which shows a better prediction effect than the other three models and can be used for regional precipitation prediction.},

   abstract = {Accurate medium and long-term precipitation forecasting plays a vital role in disaster prevention and mitigation and rational allocation of water resources. In recent years, there are various methods for medium and long-term precipitation forecasting based on machine learning algorithms. However, machine learning has a high demand for the size of sample data. Therefore, this paper proposes a data augmentation algorithm based on K-means clustering algorithm and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which can effectively enhance sample information. Besides, through constructing random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are respectively constructed as the models to forecast monthly grid precipitation of the Danjiangkou River Basin. This study aims to improve the accuracy of medium and long-term precipitation forecasting. The main results are two aspects: (1) In most years, the ACC and Pg score of SMOTE-km-XGB and SMOTE-kmRF exceeds that of XGB and RF. Furthermore, compared with the other three methods, SMOTE-km-XGB method is more suitable for precipitation forecasting in the studied basin in this paper. (2) The forecasting results of two deep learning methods (RNN and LSTM) show that the sample data processed by K-means clustering algorithm and SMOTE data augmentation algorithm have not achieved considerable results in deep learning. This study improves the accuracy of precipitation forecast by expanding and balancing the information of sample data, and provides a new research idea for improving the accuracy of medium- and long-term hydrological forecasting.},

   abstract = {Gridded satellite precipitation datasets are useful in hydrological applications as they cover large regions with high density. However, they are not accurate in the sense that they do not agree with ground-based measurements. An established means for improving their accuracy is to correct them by adopting machine learning algorithms. This correction takes the form of a regression problem, in which the ground-based measurements have the role of the dependent variable and the satellite data are the predictor variables, together with topography factors (e.g., elevation). Most studies of this kind involve a limited number of machine learning algorithms and are conducted for a small region and for a limited time period. Thus, the results obtained through them are of local importance and do not provide more general guidance and best practices. To provide results that are generalizable and to contribute to the delivery of best practices, we here compare eight state-of-theart machine learning algorithms in correcting satellite precipitation data for the entire contiguous United States and for a 15-year period. We use monthly data from the PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artiﬁcial Neural Networks) gridded dataset, together with monthly earth-observed precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network monthly database, version 2 (GHCNm). The results suggest that extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forests are the most accurate in terms of the squared error scoring function. The remaining algorithms can be ordered as follows, from the best to the worst: Bayesian regularized feed-forward neural networks, multivariate adaptive polynomial splines (poly-MARS), gradient boosting machines (gbm), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), feed-forward neural networks and linear regression.},

   abstract = {The nature of streamflow in the basins is stochastic and complex making it difficult to make an accurate prediction about the future river flows. Recently, artificial neural-based deep learning models with a nonlinear structure have become predominant in water engineering forecasting problems such as river flow predictions. In this study, we investigate the potential of Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA), Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and attribute selection pre-processing approaches with the neural network methods in predicting monthly river streamflows in the Nallihan stream, Turkey. Antecedent measured streamflow, precipitation, relative humidity and temperature data between the years 1996 and 2016 from the observing stations in the basin boundaries were used as model inputs under different scenarios using the correlations between the past measured variables, to predict one-step-ahead flow data. To compare the newer hybrid model performances; evaluation metrics including coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NE), Willmott’s Index of Agreement (WI), root mean square error, mean absolute error together with judicious plots; scatter plot, time series and the Taylor diagrams were utilized. The developed hybrid SSA-based models registered higher accuracy than other standalone Neural Networks models without pre-processing approaches. The R2 for SSA-based models were higher ranging from 0.8300 to 0.9105, and the largest R2 = 0.9105 was registered by the proposed SSA-ANN model. SSA-ANN models have also the highest NE and WI index values: 0.9045 and 0.9764, respectively. The outcomes revealed that based on NE, the SSA decomposition increased the monthly streamflow prediction accuracy by 24.11%, 18.40% and 5.11% of respective ANN, CNN and LSTM methods. The SSA pre-processing approach is able to unveil the embedded streamflow characteristics and could be further applied in basins with similar characteristics to attain more accurate predictions of river flows.},

   abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems that regulate atmosphere–hydrosphere–biosphere interactions. Several studies have suggested that global ET has significantly increased in the past several decades, and that such increase has exhibited big spatial variability, but there are few detailed studies on the spatio-temporal change in ET over China. Here, we developed a high-resolution data-oriented monthly ET product in China between 1982 and 2015 by integrating remote-sensing and the eddy covariance technique observed ET data in a machine learning approach (model tree ensemble, MTE). We showed that the mean annual ET over China is 552 ± 14 mm yr−1, which is comparable to the estimate from a MTE-derived product based on water balance, but is larger than that from both previous MTE-derived global product and process-based land surface models. ET in China significantly increased with a rate of 10.7 mm yr−1 per decade over the past 30 years (p < 0.05). The largest increases in ET (>60 mm yr−1 per decade) occurred in the eastern periphery of Sichuan, southern Taiwan, and central China, which was attributed to the increases in temperature and solar radiation, as well as the enhanced vegetation productivity. About 22% of the area showed a decreasing trend in ET, mainly in parts of southeastern, southwestern, and northeastern China. The regional decrease in ET was likely due to decreasing precipitation and/or vegetation browning. Although our finding of the significant increase in China’s ET at the country scale is supported by five different ET products, there are still less agreement on the change in ET at the regional scale among different ET products.},

   abstract = {Statistical models were developed for downscaling reanalysis data to monthly precipitation at 48 observation stations scattered across the Australian State of Victoria belonging to wet, intermediate and dry climate regimes. Downscaling models were calibrated over the period 1950–1991 and validated over the period 1992–2014 for each calendar month, for each station, using 4 machine learning techniques, (1) Genetic Programming (GP), (2) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), (3) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (4) Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). It was found that, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, downscaling models tend to better simulate the average (compared to other statistics) and under-estimate the standard deviation and the maximum of the observed precipitation. Also, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, at the majority of stations downscaling models showed an over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles (i.e. below the 50th percentile) of precipitation and under-estimating trend of high percentiles of precipitation (i.e. above the 90th percentile). The over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles of precipitation was more pronounced at stations located in dryer climate, irrespective of the machine learning technique. Based on the results of this investigation the use of RVM or ANN over SVM or GP for developing downscaling models can be recommended for a study such as flood prediction which involves the consideration of high extremes of precipitation. Also, RVM can be recommended over GP, ANN or SVM in developing downscaling models for a study such as drought analysis which involves the consideration of low extremes of precipitation. Furthermore, it was found that irrespective of the climate regime, the SVM and RVM-based precipitation downscaling models showed the best performance with the Polynomial kernel.},

   abstract = {The escalating global threat of forest fires, driven by global warming, requires the development of effective prediction systems to mitigate damages. This research focuses on Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) states in central India, where forest fire risk has become particularly pronounced. The primary objectives of the study are to quantify and map the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires over the period 2001 to 2020, and to predict future fire risks using satellite derived datasets and machine learning techniques. Through a long-term analysis, the study revealed an alarming increase in the number of forest fire incidents in MP and CG. From an average of 1200 and 1000 during 2001 to 2005, the incidents increased to 2800 and 2100 during 2016 to 2020, in MP and CG respectively. To predict forest fire risk, Random Forest machine learning algorithm was adopted utilizing various satellite derived climatic, topographical, and ecological parameters such as temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, NDVI, soil moisture, litter availability, evapotranspiration and terrain parameters (at monthly scale for 20 years). While forecasting fire probability for 2018–2020, the model achieves high accuracy rate of 86.46 % in MP and 93.78 % in CG. The results highlight significant forest fire likelihood regions in the central MP and the Southern CG, identifying areas requiring enhanced fire management strategies. This study has revealed that NDVI and rainfall have played a positive role in restricting the forest fire, and their negative anomaly amplified the fire risk. The study would help forest planners and administrators to characterise vulnerable areas and prioritise their conservation provisions.},

   abstract = {Brazil has extensive forests and savannas on deep weathered soils and plays a key role in the discussions about carbon sequestration, but the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks up to 1 m depth has not been investigated in Brazil using machine learning techniques. In this study, we applied a methodological framework to optimize the prediction of SOC stocks for the entire Brazilian territory and determine how the environmental heterogeneity of Brazil influences the SOC stocks distribution. We used a legacy dataset of 8227 soil profiles which consisted of 37,693 samples. For each profile, the vertical distribution of SOC and bulk density were interpolated to standard depths (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60 and 60–100 cm) using mass preserving equal-area quadratic splines. The covariates database was composed of 74 variables including bioclimatic (temperature and precipitation) data, soil and biome maps, vegetation indexes and morphometric maps derived from a digital elevation model, with a 1 km spatial resolution. To obtain the best prediction performance, we tested four machine learning algorithms: Random Forests, Cubist, Generalized Linear Model Boosting and Support Vector Machines. Random Forests showed the best performance in predicting SOC stocks for all depths, with the highest performance at 30–60 cm for training (R2 = 0.32) and validation (R2 = 0.33); hence, it was selected for the spatial prediction of SOC stocks. The most important covariates selected by Random Forests using the recursive feature elimination were: soil class, sum of monthly mean temperature (SAMT), precipitation, slope height and vegetation indexes (NDVI, GPP). In total, Brazilian soils store approximately 71.3 PgC within the top 100 cm, where the first 0–30 cm contains almost 36 PgC. Approximately 31% of the total SOC stocks (22.2 PgC) occurs in protected areas (2.6 million km2), which are not subjected to land use pressure and carbon losses. Although the Amazon biome has the highest amount of stored SOC (36.1 PgC), its soils do not represent a good potential for carbon accumulation. Among soil classes, the Luvisols showed the lowest SOC density (6.45 kg m−2) and the Histosols presented the highest values (14.87 kg m−2). More than 57% of the total SOC was found in nutrient-poor, deep-weathered Ferralsols and Acrisols, which are the dominant soils in Brazil. The presented methodological framework covers all steps of prediction process, building maps with known accuracy and has great potential to be used in future soil carbon inventories at large scales. Concerning conservation issues, the results highlight the importance of nature reserves for protecting SOC in the long-term.},

This study proposes a “gray box” approach to address the challenge by incorporating expert domain knowledge (i.e., human intelligence) with machine learning techniques (i.e., machine intelligence). Specifically, we propose using directed information graph (DIG), boosted regression trees (BRT), and domain knowledge to infer causal factors and identify behavioral rules from data. A case study is conducted to investigate farmers' pumping behavior in the Midwest, U.S.A. Results show that four factors identified by the DIG algorithm- corn price, underlying groundwater level, monthly mean temperature and precipitation- have main causal influences on agents’ decisions on monthly groundwater irrigation depth. The agent-based model is then developed based on the behavioral rules represented by three DIGs and modeled by BRTs, and coupled with a physically-based groundwater model to investigate the impacts of agents’ pumping behavior on the underlying groundwater system in the context of coupled human and environmental systems.},

   abstract = {Groundwater plays an important role in maintaining vegetation structure and ecological functions in arid regions. However, the relationship between groundwater depth (GD) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in a large region with various climate conditions remains poorly understood, primarily due to the complex influence of multiple environmental factors. Machine learning method, a powerful tool for identifying complex and nonlinear processes, has been used to rank explanatory variables on the regional-scale vegetation distribution, while missing the vegetation-groundwater relationship. We developed machine learning models via the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to identify key controls of groundwater-dependent vegetation cover in the Yellow River Basin, China. Two XGBoost models, A and B, were constructed for shallow (GD ≤ 24.5 m) and deep (GD > 24.5 m) groundwater pixels, respectively, with the same sample number on the resolution of 1 km. Shapely additive explanations (SHAP) method is employed to assess the contributions of climatic, topographic, and edaphic features on FVC. Through an enhanced feature selection method using multicollinearity analysis and the Boruta algorithm, we found that the top four important features in both models were precipitation (P), saturated water content (SWC), air temperature (TA), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) during the growing season. The difference between models A and B indicates the influence of groundwater on vegetation. Shallower groundwater leads to smaller sensitivity of FVC to the precipitation when the monthly P in the growing season is smaller than 68.0 mm, and can also reduce the sensitivity of FVC to the air temperature when the average TA is lower than 13.5℃ in the growing season. This study suggests an effective method for recognizing the groundwater effect on the vegetation cover from mixed influences of environmental controls.},

   abstract = {Predicting water table depth over the long-term in agricultural areas presents great challenges because these areas have complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, boundary conditions, and human activities; also, nonlinear interactions occur among these factors. Therefore, a new time series model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models. The proposed model is composed of an LSTM layer with another fully connected layer on top of it, with a dropout method applied in the first LSTM layer. In this study, the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub-areas of Hetao Irrigation District in arid northwestern China using data of 14 years (2000–2013). The proposed model uses monthly water diversion, evaporation, precipitation, temperature, and time as input data to predict water table depth. A simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre-process data to ensure data on the same scale. 14 years of data are separated into two sets: training set (2000–2011) and validation set (2012–2013) in the experiment. As expected, the proposed model achieves higher R2 scores (0.789–0.952) in water table depth prediction, when compared with the results of traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN), which only reaches relatively low R2 scores (0.004–0.495), proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well. Furthermore, the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model’s architecture are discussed. Through experimentation, the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly. In addition, comparisons between the R2 scores of the proposed model and Double-LSTM model (R2 scores range from 0.170 to 0.864), further prove that the proposed model’s architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data. Thus, one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth, especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain.},

   abstract = {In this paper, several soft computing approaches were employed for rainfall prediction. Two aspects were considered to improve the accuracy of rainfall prediction: (1) carrying out a data-preprocessing procedure and (2) adopting a modular modeling method. The proposed preprocessing techniques included moving average (MA) and singular spectrum analysis (SSA). The modular models were composed of local support vectors regression (SVR) models or/and local artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) models. In the process of rainfall forecasting, the ANN was ﬁrst used to choose datapreprocessing method from MA and SSA. Modular models involved preprocessing the training data into three crisp subsets (low, medium and high levels) according to the magnitudes of the training data, and ﬁnally two SVRs were performed in the medium and high-level subsets whereas ANN or SVR was involved in training and predicting the low-level subset. For daily rainfall record, the low-level subset tended to be modeled by the ANN because it was overwhelming in the training data, which is based on the fact that the ANN is very efﬁcient in training large-size samples due to its parallel information processing conﬁguration. Four rainfall time series consisting of two monthly rainfalls and two daily rainfalls from different regions were utilized to evaluate modular models at 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day lead-time with the persistence method and the global ANN as benchmarks. Results showed that the MA was superior to the SSA when they were coupled with the ANN. Comparison results indicated that modular models (referred to as ANN-SVR for daily rainfall simulations and MSVR for monthly rainfall simulations) outperformed other models. The ANN-MA also displayed considerable accuracy in rainfall forecasts compared with the benchmark.},

A comparison of seven input techniques, either linear or nonlinear, indicates that linear correlation analysis (LCA) is capable of identifying model inputs reasonably. A proposed model, modular artiﬁcial neural network (MANN), is compared with three benchmark models, viz. artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), K-nearest-neighbors (K-NN), and linear regression (LR). Prediction is performed in the context of two modes including normal mode (viz., without data preprocessing) and data preprocessing mode. Results from the normal mode indicate that MANN performs the best among all four models, but the advantage of MANN over ANN is not signiﬁcant in monthly rainfall series forecasting. Under the data preprocessing mode, each of LR, K-NN and ANN is respectively coupled with three data-preprocessing techniques including moving average (MA), principal component analysis (PCA), and singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Results indicate that the improvement of model performance generated by SSA is considerable whereas those of MA or PCA are slight. Moreover, when MANN is coupled with SSA, results show that advantages of MANN over other models are quite noticeable, particularly for daily rainfall forecasting. Therefore, the proposed optimal rainfall forecasting model can be derived from MANN coupled with SSA.},

   abstract = {Rainfall forecasting plays many important role in water resources studies such as river training works and design of ﬂood warning systems. Recent advancement in artiﬁcial intelligence and in particular techniques aimed at converting input to output for highly nonlinear, non-convex and dimensionalized processes such as rainfall ﬁeld, provide an alternative approach for developing rainfall forecasting model. Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs), which perform a nonlinear mapping between inputs and outputs, are such a technique. Current literatures on artiﬁcial neural networks show that the selection of network architecture and its eﬃcient training procedure are major obstacles for their daily usage. In this paper, feed-forward type networks will be developed to simulate the rainfall ﬁeld and a socalled back propagation (BP) algorithm coupled with genetic algorithm (GA) will be used to train and optimize the networks. The technique will be implemented to forecast rainfall for a number of times using rainfall hyetograph of recording rain gauges in the Upper Parramatta catchment in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. Results of the study showed the structuring of ANN network with the input parameter selection, when coupled with GA, performed better compared to similar work of using ANN alone.},

   abstract = {Rainfall forecasting is vital for making important decisions and performing strategic planning in agriculturedependent countries. Despite its importance, statistical rainfall forecasting, especially for long-term, has been proven to be a great challenge due to the dynamic nature of climate phenomena and random fluctuations involved in the process. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have recently become very popular and they are one of the most widely used forecasting models that have enjoyed fruitful applications for forecasting purposes in many domains of engineering and computer science. The main contribution of this research is in the design, implementation and comparison of rainfall forecasting models using Focused TimeDelay Neural Networks (FTDNN). The optimal parameters of the neural network architectures were obtained from experiments while networks were trained to perform one-step-ahead predictions. The daily rainfall dataset, obtained from Malaysia Meteorological Department (MMD), was converted to monthly, biannually, quarterly and monthly datasets. Training and testing were performed on each of the datasets and corresponding accuracies of the forecasts were measured using Mean Absolute Percent Error. For testing data, results indicate that yearly rainfall dataset gives the most accurate forecasts (94.25%). As future work, more parameters such as temperature, humidity and sunshine data can be incorporated into the neural network for superior forecasting performance.},

   abstract = {An accurate rainfall forecasting is a challenging problem for agriculture dependent countries like India for analyzing the crop productivity, use of water resources and preplanning of water resources. Statistical techniques for rainfall forecasting cannot perform well for long-term rainfall forecasting due to the dynamic nature of climate phenomena. The daily rainfall dataset for Navsari and Anand regions are obtained and converted to monthly and yearly datasets for experimentations. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), and Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) techniques are used for rainfall prediction. These techniques use input parameters such as evaporation, wind speed, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and relative humidity for rainfall prediction. The proposed approach uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing biases and weights of neural network. The results of ARIMA model are compared with the results obtained using three neural network models. From results, it is found that the neural network techniques performed well compared to the ARIMA model. The GA-TDNN is trained with Levenberg Marquardt Back Propagation algorithm and gives better performance than other NN models. The GA-TDNN model achieved monthly rainfall prediction accuracy of 89.83% and 81.38% for Anand and Navsari regions, respectively. In yearly prediction, the model achieved accuracy of 87.87%, and 87.86% for Anand and Navsari respectively.},

By feeding the atmospheric data array into the CNN algorithm as an input, the algorithm was trained to classify whether there will be rain in the next 30 min. The trained models demonstrate promising results for three different cities in Japan, with a 64 – 76 % detection ratio for a 30 min prediction lead time. The high false alarm ratio is an issue that should be addressed in further research, with additional input data.

In this study, an eﬀort has been conducted to downscale and evaluate a satellite precipitation estimation (SPE) product using artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), and to impose a residual correction method for ﬁve separate daily heavy precipitation events localized over northeast Austria. For the ANN model, a precipitation variable was the chosen output and the inputs were temperature, MODIS cloud optical, and microphysical variables. The particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm,(ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA) were utilized to improve the performance of ANN. Moreover, to examine the eﬃciency of the networks, the downscaled product was evaluated using 54 rain gauges at a daily timescale. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted to obtain the most and least inﬂuential input parameters. Among the optimized algorithms for network training used in this study, the performance of the ICA slightly outperformed other algorithms. The best-recorded performance for ICA was on 17 April 2015 with root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.26 mm, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.06 mm, R2 = 0.67, bias = 0.07 mm. The results showed that the prediction of precipitation was more sensitive to cloud optical thickness (COT). Moreover, the accuracy of the ﬁnal downscaled satellite precipitation was improved signiﬁcantly through residual correction algorithms.},

Consequently, how to get the rainfall of any part of the valley attracts more and more attention. In this study, the main meteorological parameters which influencing the rainfall can be extracted from the MODIS satellite cloud imagery, and these meteorological parameters are combined with the actual observed rainfall data which is obtained from ground-based rainfall site correspondingly. The remote sensing retrieval model is established respectively based on the BP neural network and GA-BP neural network, and a better effect of error precision estimation is obtained. It's also proved that the high resolution of MODIS cloud products can be used to estimate rainfall rate.},

Yet the scarce samples and the self limitation of the conventional forecast method make the precision low. The support vector regression machine (SVRM) is based on Statistics Learning Theory with the rule of the structure risk minimum. It has some merits, such as dealing with the data of small sample, the high dimension, the global optimization and the excellent generalization ability. As far as the problem of the memory which the accessing kernel matrix increases with the number of samples is concerned, solving the Lagrange multipliers (the coefficient of the samples) is the difficult. The paper adopts the common optimal method---genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the sample coefficients. Compared with the traditional models of urban water demand forecast, GA-SVRM is based on the stable math theory, has the high precision forecast, better applicability, general value in the complex ecological water demand prediction.},

   abstract = {Hydroelectric power generation, water supplies for municipal, agricultural, manufacturing, and service industry uses including technology-sector requirements, dam safety, flood control, recreational uses, and ecological and legal constraints, all place simultaneous, competing demands on the heavily stressed water management infrastructure of the mostly arid American West. Optimally managing these resources depends on predicting water availability. We built a probabilistic nonlinear regression water supply forecast (WSF) technique for the US Department of Agriculture, which runs the largest stand-alone WSF system in the US West. Design criteria included improved accuracy over the existing system; uncertainty estimates that seamlessly handle complex (heteroscedastic, non-Gaussian) prediction errors; integration of physical hydrometeorological process knowledge and domain-specific expert experience; ability to accommodate nonlinearity, model selection uncertainty and equifinality, and predictor multicollinearity and high dimensionality; and relatively easy, low-cost implementation. Some methods satisfied some of these requirements but none met all, leading us to develop a novel, interdisciplinary, and pragmatic prediction metasystem through a carefully considered synthesis of well-established, off-the-shelf components and approaches, spanning supervised and unsupervised machine learning, nonparametric statistical modeling, ensemble learning, and evolutionary optimization, focusing on maintaining but radically updating the principal components regression framework widely used for WSF. Testing this integrated multi-method prediction engine demonstrated its value for river forecasting; USDA adoption is a landmark for transitioning machine learning from research into practice in this field. Its ability to handle all the foregoing design criteria and requirements, which are not unique to WSF, suggests potential for extension to complex probabilistic prediction problems in other fields.},

A difference of 37.006 mm was obtained in terms of RMSE compared with ACCESS and 15.941 compared with conventional MLP. Further investigation revealed that the CNN was generally performing better in months with higher annual averages, while ACCESS was performing better in months with low annual averages.

   abstract = {Precipitation plays a significant role in the hydrological cycle and atmospheric circulation. However, estimating precipitation is a challenging task due to the high spatiotemporal variability of precipitation. The development of machine learning has marked a new approach to precipitation estimation. In this study, a stacking ensemble machine learning model was developed to estimate 6-hour precipitation at a high spatial resolution of 5 km based on Himawari-8 and ground stations data over China. Metrological and topographic factors are considered ancillary data. The stacking model consists of two levels. Three sub-models, namely, extremely randomized trees, extreme gradient boosting, and deep neural networks, were trained respectively in level-1 of the stacking model. Level-2 linearly combines sub-models to achieve the final estimation. Evaluation results over China indicate that the stacking model outperforms the individual model, with a correlation coefficient of 0.630, a mean absolute error of 1.431 mm/6 hr, and a root mean square error of 4.248 mm/6 hr. The performance of the proposed model is better than several widely used precipitation products (IMERG, GSMaP, and ERA5). In particular, the detection rate of heavy precipitation (≥16.9 mm/6 hr) in our model, with a probability of detection of 0.97, is distinctly superior to that of the other products. The precipitation estimations are accumulated and plotted at different temporal scales, contrasting with these products. The spatial patterns appear to be relatively coincident at annual and daily scales. More importantly, the spatial patterns of our model are more reliable than those of the products due to its smaller mean bias. The study provided a novel alternative for producing improved high-resolution precipitation datasets with high accuracy.},

   abstract = {Abstract Variations in monthly precipitation are associated with climate extremes having significant socio-economic and eco-environmental impacts. Knowledge of monthly precipitation information is therefore valuable for policy making. Extensive research has been conducted on dynamic prediction using state-of-the-art coupled climate models. However, the skilful prediction of monthly precipitation with dynamical models remains a challenge. With the development of machine learning tools, statistical predictions show comparable performance with dynamic models, but they are limited to at-site monthly prediction, due to the lack of ability for processing spatially connected geophysical data. To improve monthly precipitation forecasting and provide regional forecasts, we propose a model termed UNet-RegPre based on convolutional neural network and U-net architecture. The model shows comparable prediction skills with recurrent state-of-the-art dynamic forecasts (CFSv2), and has the capability to capture spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and reproduce the main process of representative droughts. The key precursors for rainfall development identified by UNet-RegPre shows that the constructed model can detect the climatic connection between rainfall in eastern China and summer monsoon, showing the potential to advance hydrometeorological understanding with a deep learning-based model. These results suggest that the proposed model can be a potential tool for precipitation prediction.},

   abstract = {Recent climate conditions in India have led to numerous disasters, including floods, overflowing rivers, broken dams, and reduced vegetation. Machine learning aims to train models to make predictions based on historical data. Although many studies have focused on predictions and model building, this research introduces a novel integrated framework using a Stacked Heterogeneous Ensemble Model (SHEM). It aims to enhance prediction accuracy by employing another novel approach for imputing missing values, the Variable Specific Hot Deck (VSHD) imputation method. The outcomes were contrasted with established machine learning techniques, including random forest, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine. After completing the imputation, we proceeded to implement the SHEM model. Real-time climate data for the Cuddalore location in Tamil Nadu state, South India was collected from the NASA Power Access viewer portal to verify the accuracy level of the proposed model. Performance analysis indicates that the proposed imputation outperforms all four alternative models with a 30% average improvement in accuracy. Moreover, the developed SHEM model has a reduced RMSE value of 0.321 and an R-squared value of 0.952 and shows a 9% improvement in accuracy compared to the base model’s performance. Furthermore, these prediction results are compared to an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a deep learning model to calculate accuracy and loss, showing that the proposed achieves high accuracy and significant loss during validation. The obtained results can serve as a guideline for atmospheric scientists and various weather forecasting applications, helping them to choose the most appropriate machine learning method for their prediction task.},

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder.

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase.

Cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER), and cloud water path (CWP) are used to statistically downscale IMERG precipitation estimates from 0.1 to 0.01° spatial resolution, using the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) and residual correction methods. The downscaled precipitation estimates were subsequently validated using in situ rain gauge measurements. The residual corrected IMERG downscaled precipitation estimates were found to be more accurate than the downscaled predicted precipitation without the implementation of the residual correction algorithm (up to 37%), with a respective decrease of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (up to 75%), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) (up to 79%), and the Percent Bias (PB) (up to 98%). In addition, the final downscaled product after the MLR method implementation with residual correction was better correlated with the rain gauge observations than the initial IMERG product (up to 20%). Thus, the implementation of the MLR method in conjunction with the residual correction algorithm is an efficient tool for downscaling remote sensing products with a coarse spatial resolution.},

Predicting the occurrence of rainfall plays a major role especially in an agricultural area with untimely rainfall like La Trinidad, Benguet. For a more efficient irrigation scheduling, a reliable method for rainfall prediction is needed. This entails the adaptation and utilization of suitable prediction approaches and techniques. Various analytical approaches and methods are made available to develop new techniques to predict future possibilities. This study aimed to propose an approach in predicting the occurrence and non-occurrence of rainfall in La Trinidad, Benguet based on various historical weather parameters. Five machine learning classification algorithms were used to build the predictive models for the weather dataset namely: Fine Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant, Course K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Support Vector Machines, and Neural Network. A poor choice of model cannot further improve the predictions. To choose between models, focus must be put on the appropriate evaluation metrics. Among the 5 models, results suggest that Course K-Nearest Neighbor gives the highest performance in all the evaluation metrics. Course KNN, with a good accuracy of 81.1% proves to be the best model to use in predicting rainfall in La Trinidad, Benguet. Course KNN model evaluation reveals that Machine Learning Classification can be adopted to predict the occurrence and non-occurrence of rainfall.},

Therefore, forecasting and monitoring climatic events are fundamental issues for society and various sectors of the economy. In the last decades, machine learning models have been developed to tackle different issues in society, but there is still a gap in applications to applied physics. Here, different machine learning models are evaluated for precipitation prediction over South America. Currently, numerical weather prediction models are unable to precisely reproduce the precipitation patterns in South America due to many factors such as the lack of region-specific parametrizations and data availability. The results are compared to the general circulation atmospheric model currently used operationally in the National Institute for Space Research (INPE: Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), Brazil. Machine learning models are able to produce predictions with errors under 2 mm in most of the continent in comparison to satellite-observed precipitation patterns for different climate seasons, and also outperform INPE’s model for some regions (e.g., reduction of errors from 8 to 2 mm in central South America in winter). Another advantage is the computational performance from machine learning models, running faster with much lower computer resources than models based on differential equations currently used in operational centers. Therefore, it is important to consider machine learning models for precipitation forecasts in operational centers as a way to improve forecast quality and to reduce computation costs.},

   abstract = {The intensive research of recent years on climate change has led to the strong conclusion that climate has always, throughout the Earth's history, changed irregularly on all time scales. Climate changes are closely related to the Hurst phenomenon, which has been detected in many long hydroclimatic time series and is stochastically equivalent to a simple scaling behaviour of climate variability over time scale. The climate variability, anthropogenic or natural, increases the uncertainty of the hydrological processes. It is shown that hydrological statistics, the branch of hydrology that deals with uncertainty, in its current state is not consistent with the varying character of climate. Typical statistics used in hydrology such as means, variances, cross- and autocorrelations and Hurst coefficients, and the variability thereof, are revisited under the hypothesis of a varying climate following a simple scaling law, and new estimators are studied which, in many cases, differ dramatically from the classical ones. The new statistical framework is applied to real-world examples for typical tasks such as estimation and hypothesis testing where, again, the results depart significantly from those of the classical statistics.},

Patz et al. consider the available evidence and suggest that climate warming already contributes to ill health and thousands of premature deaths across the world, and is likely to have serious health implications in the future. Recent work suggests that some regions are particularly at risk: areas where climate is dominated by El Niño/Southern Oscillation events, sub-Saharan Africa, and sprawling urban areas subject to the heat island effect are already suffering from climate impacts and these are projected to increase. In many cases, regions at high risk are those least responsible for causing climate change.},

The main objective is to characterize these events as climatic objects, in terms of location, spatial extent, duration, and temporal variability. In this study, 76 VLDS events were detected in the Mediterranean Basin and grouped into four spatial patterns: scattered localized (with 25 events), northeast Mediterranean (11 events), West Mediterranean (15 events), and southeast Mediterranean (25 events). Each pattern shows seasonality in events. Most of the scattered localized, northeast, and southeast events begin in September, at the beginning of the wet season. In contrast, most of the West Mediterranean events begin in the middle of the wet season. Over time, there is a slight but not significant increase in the cumulative number of days per season affected by VLDS events.},

   abstract = {Human-induced climate change is increasingly recognized as a fundamental driver of biological processes and patterns. Historic climate change is known to have caused shifts in the geographic ranges of many taxa and future climate change is expected to result in even greater redistributions of species. As a result, predicting the impact of climate change on future patterns of biodiversity will greatly aid conservation planning. Using the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Audubon Christmas Bird Count, two of the most comprehensive continental datasets of vertebrates in the world, and correlative distribution modeling, we assessed geographic range shifts for 588 North American bird species during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons under a range of future emission scenarios (SRES A2, A1B, B2) through the end of the century. Here we show that 314 species (53%) are projected to lose more than half of their current geographic range across three scenarios of climate change through the end of the century. For 126 species, loss occurs without concomitant range expansion; whereas for 188 species, loss is coupled with potential to colonize new replacement range. We found no strong associations between projected climate sensitivities and existing conservation prioritizations. Moreover, species responses were not clearly associated with habitat affinities, migration strategies, or climate change scenarios. Our results demonstrate the need to include climate sensitivity into current conservation planning and to develop adaptive management strategies that accommodate shrinking and shifting geographic ranges. The persistence of many North American birds will depend on their ability to colonize climatically suitable areas outside of current ranges and management actions that target climate adaptation.},

   abstract = {Groundwater is a primary source of drinking water for billions worldwide. It plays a crucial role in irrigation, domestic, and industrial uses, and significantly contributes to drought resilience in various regions. However, excessive groundwater discharge has left many areas vulnerable to potable water shortages. Therefore, assessing groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) is essential for implementing sustainable management practices to ensure the availability of groundwater for present and future generations. This study aims to delineate areas with high groundwater potential in the Bankura district of West Bengal using four machine learning methods: Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Voting Ensemble (VE). The models used 161 data points, comprising 70% of the training dataset, to identify significant correlations between the presence and absence of groundwater in the region. Among the methods, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) proved to be the most effective in mapping groundwater potential, suggesting their applicability in other regions with similar hydrogeological conditions. The performance metrics for RF are very good with a precision of 0.919, recall of 0.971, F1-score of 0.944, and accuracy of 0.943. This indicates a strong capability to accurately predict groundwater zones with minimal false positives and negatives. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) demonstrated comparable performance across all metrics (precision: 0.919, recall: 0.971, F1-score: 0.944, accuracy: 0.943), highlighting its effectiveness in predicting groundwater potential areas accurately; whereas, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed the other models slightly, with higher values in all metrics: precision (0.944), recall (0.971), F1-score (0.958), and accuracy (0.957), suggesting a more refined model performance. The Voting Ensemble (VE) approach also showed enhanced performance, mirroring XGBoost’s metrics (precision: 0.944, recall: 0.971, F1-score: 0.958, accuracy: 0.957). This indicates that combining the strengths of individual models leads to better predictions. The groundwater potentiality zoning across the Bankura district varied significantly, with areas of very low potentiality accounting for 41.81% and very high potentiality at 24.35%. The uncertainty in predictions ranged from 0.0 to 0.75 across the study area, reflecting the variability in groundwater availability and the need for targeted management strategies.},

   abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) data can provide guidance for decision-makers in fields such as drought monitoring and irrigation management. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite offers sufficient spatial resolution for global-scale applications, but its utility is limited in regional areas due to its lower spatial resolution. To address this issue, this study proposed a downscaling framework based on the Stacking strategy. The framework integrated extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost) to generate 1 km resolution SM data using 15 high-resolution factors derived from multi-source datasets. In particular, to test the influence of terrain partitioning on downscaling results, Anhui Province, which has diverse terrain features, was selected as the study area. The results indicated that the performance of the three base models varied, and the developed Stacking strategy maximized the potential of each model with encouraging downscaling results. Specifically, we found that: (1) The Stacking model achieved the highest accuracy in all regions, and the performance order of the base models was: XGBoost > CatBoost > LightGBM. (2) Compared with the measured SM at 87 sites, the downscaled SM outperformed other 1 km SM products as well as the downscaled SM without partitioning, with an average ubRMSE of 0.040 m3/m3. (3) The downscaled SM responded positively to rainfall events and mitigated the systematic bias of SMAP. It also preserved the spatial trend of the original SMAP, with higher levels in the humid region and relatively lower levels in the semi-humid region. Overall, this study provided a new strategy for soil moisture downscaling and revealed some interesting findings related to the effectiveness of the Stacking model and the impact of terrain partitioning on downscaling accuracy.},

   abstract = {Due to the rapidly increasing demand for groundwater, as one of the principal freshwater resources, there is an urge to advance novel prediction systems to more accurately estimate the groundwater potential for an informed groundwater resource management. Ensemble machine learning methods are generally reported to produce more accurate results. However, proposing the novel ensemble models along with running comparative studies for performance evaluation of these models would be equally essential to precisely identify the suitable methods. Thus, the current study is designed to provide knowledge on the performance of the four ensemble models i.e., Boosted generalized additive model (GamBoost), adaptive Boosting classification trees (AdaBoost), Bagged classification and regression trees (Bagged CART), and random forest (RF). To build the models, 339 groundwater resources’ locations and the spatial groundwater potential conditioning factors were used. Thereafter, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was applied to identify the key features. The RFE specified that the best number of features for groundwater potential modeling was 12 variables among 15 (with a mean Accuracy of about 0.84). The modeling results indicated that the Bagging models (i.e., RF and Bagged CART) had a higher performance than the Boosting models (i.e., AdaBoost and GamBoost). Overall, the RF model outperformed the other models (with accuracy = 0.86, Kappa = 0.67, Precision = 0.85, and Recall = 0.91). Also, the topographic position index’s predictive variables, valley depth, drainage density, elevation, and distance from stream had the highest contribution in the modeling process. Groundwater potential maps predicted in this study can help water resources managers and policymakers in the fields of watershed and aquifer management to preserve an optimal exploit from this important freshwater.},

This study aimed at predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in the lake Tana sub-basin from 1990 to 2020. A satellite-based rainfall estimate of Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data was used with the same spanning period. The validation process employs point-to-pixel analysis, comparing CHIRPS estimates with observed data at speciﬁc gauge stations. The ﬁndings showed that CHIRPS had well estimated rainfall incidence in the highland areas and signiﬁcantly overestimated it in the lowland areas. The Mann–Kendall trends for January, June, and August indicate decreasing trends, while the winter and spring seasons show notable declines. Regression analysis reveals a non-signiﬁcant decrease in annual rainfall with the highest in the summer and relatively dry winters. In addition, the coefﬁcient of variation value of 26.37% suggests a moderate level of variability around the mean annual rainfall. In conclusion, the CHIRPS satellite exhibited varied performance across the Tana sub-basin, with site-speciﬁc discrepancies and notable inaccuracies at certain stations. The study underscores the importance of considering local factors and topography in satellite-based rainfall assessments, providing valuable insights for agricultural planning in the region.},

Weather forecasts, especially precipitation prediction, poses complex tasks because they depend on various parameters to predict the dependent variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, which are changing from time to time and weather calculation varies with the geographical location along with its atmospheric variables. To improve the prediction accuracy of precipitation, this context proposes a prediction model for rainfall forecast based on Support Vector Machine with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-SVM) to replace the linear threshold used in traditional precipitation. Parameter selection has a critical impact on the predictive accuracy of SVM, and PSO is proposed to ﬁnd the optimal parameters for SVM. The PSO-SVM algorithm was used for the training of a model by using the historical data for precipitation prediction, which can be useful information and used by people of all walks of life in making wise and intelligent decisions. The simulations demonstrate that prediction models indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm has much better accuracy than the direct prediction model based on a set of experimental data if other things are equal. On the other hand, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the SVM-PSO model used in machine learning and further promises the scope for improvement as more and more relevant attributes can be used in predicting the dependent variables.},

   abstract = {Obtaining high-quality quantitative precipitation forecasts is a key precondition for hydrological forecast systems. Due to multisource uncertainties (e.g., initial conditions, model structures, and parameters), raw forecasts are subject to systematic biases; hence, statistical postprocessing is often required to reduce these errors before the forecasts can proceed to hydrological applications. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are canonical statistical models, and they are diverse in type and variation. It is important to verify and compare their performance in the same scenario (e.g., precipitation postprocessing). In this paper, we conduct a large-scale comparison study for the major ML models with diverse model structures and regularization strategies as postprocessors for improving the quality of precipitation forecasts. Speciﬁcally, we compare the efﬁciency and effectiveness of 21 ML algorithms on solving this task. Daily reforecast precipitation with lead times up to 8 days from the Global Ensemble Forecast System and corresponding observations are employed to determine the usability of different models in the Yalong River basin in China. The performance of each model is validated by a group of carefully designed experiments and statistical metrics. The results reveal that improvements in model structures are more effective than regularization strategies. Among these algorithms, the optimized extra-trees regressor exhibits the best performance, effectively reducing overestimation and achieving the best skill in forecasting precipitation. Eleven ensemble members and a 3-day forward-rolling time window can be used as predictors to obtain the best model performance. The systematic experiments and ﬁndings also offer useful guidelines for other related studies.},

   abstract = {Practical information can be drawn from rainfall for making long-term water resources management plans, taking flood mitigation measures, and even establishing proper irrigation systems. Given that a large amount of data with high resolution is required for physical modeling, this study proposes a new standalone sequential minimal optimization (SMO) regression model and develops its ensembles using Dagging (DA), random committee (RC), and additive regression (AR) models (i.e., DA-SMO, RC-SMO, and AR-SMO) for rainfall prediction. First, 30-year monthly data derived from the year 1988 to 2018 including evaporation, maximum and minimum temperatures, maximum and minimum relative humidity rates, sunshine hours, and wind speed as input and rainfall as the output were acquired from a synoptic station in Kermanshah, Iran. Next, based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r-value) between input and output variables, different input scenarios were formed. Then, the dataset was separated into three subsets: development (1988–2008), calibration (2009–2010), and validation (2011–2018). Finally, the performance of the developed algorithms was validated using different visual (scatterplot and boxplot) and quantitative (percentage of BIAS, root mean square error, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, and mean absolute error) metrics. The results revealed that minimum relative humidity had the greatest effect on rainfall prediction. The most effective input scenario featured all the input variables except for wind speed. Our findings indicated that the DA-SMO ensemble algorithm outperformed other algorithms.},

   abstract = {Runoff plays an essential part in the hydrological cycle, as it regulates the quantity of water which ﬂows into streams and returns surplus water into the oceans. Runoff modelling may assist in understanding, controlling, and monitoring the quality and amount of water resources. The aim of this article is to discuss various categories of rainfall–runoff models, recent developments, and challenges of rainfall–runoff models in ﬂood prediction in the modern era. Rainfall–runoff models are classiﬁed into conceptual, empirical, and physical process-based models depending upon the framework and spatial processing of their algorithms. Well-known runoff models which belong to these categories include the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) model, Storm Water Management model (SWMM), Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and the Variable Inﬁltration Capacity (VIC) model, etc. In addition, the data-driven models such as Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have proven to be better performance solutions in runoff modelling and ﬂood prediction in recent decades. The data-driven models detect the best relationship based on the input data series and the output in order to model the runoff process. Finally, the strengths and downsides of the outlined models in terms of understanding variation in runoff modelling and ﬂood prediction were discussed. The ﬁndings of this comprehensive study suggested that hybrid models for runoff modeling and ﬂood prediction should be developed by combining the strengths of traditional models and machine learning methods. This article suggests future research initiatives that could help with ﬁlling existing gaps in rainfall–runoff research and will also assist hydrological scientists in selecting appropriate rainfall–runoff models for ﬂood prediction and mitigation based on their beneﬁts and drawbacks.},

   abstract = {Landslides are highly hazardous geological disasters that can potentially threaten the safety of human life and property. As a result, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) plays an important role in the landslide prevention system. Recently, many deep learning (DL) models have been adopted for LSM, but they also face problems such as sensitivity to overfitting and lower mapping accuracy. In this paper, a novel hybrid LSM framework is proposed based on four heterogeneous ensemble learning (HEL) methods with three single DL models: deep belief network (DBN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep residual network (ResNet). The proposed model is tested at the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. 202 historical landslides and ten conditioning factors were selected to construct a geospatial dataset for LSM. The conditioning factors with high-correlation and low importance were removed from the dataset by using the Spearman Correlation Index and random forests. The geospatial dataset was then divided into two subsets: 70% for training and 30% for testing. Then LSM results was carried out by the single and proposed HEL-based models. The quantitative evaluation of the results showed that the proposed HEL-based models improved the LSM accuracy, and outperformed the single DL LSM models. Stacking model achieved the highest AUC value (0.984), highest Kappa (86.95%), highest overall accuracy (94.17%), highest precision (88.87%), highest Matthews correlation coefficient (87.03%) and highest F1-score (91.34%) among all of models for the testing dataset, while the Boosting model obtained the highest Recall value (96.02%). At the same time, HEL-based models proposed in this study also show better stability and can avoid the overfitting effectively. In addition, the Gini index showed that elevation factor contributes most in LSM in the study area. In general, the proposed framework has promising applicability in improving LSM accuracy.},

This paper explores whether these deep models should be a recommended option for tabular data by rigorously comparing the new deep models to XGBoost on various datasets. In addition to systematically comparing their performance, we consider the tuning and computation they require. Our study shows that XGBoost outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in the papers that proposed the deep models. We also demonstrate that XGBoost requires much less tuning. On the positive side, we show that an ensemble of deep models and XGBoost performs better on these datasets than XGBoost alone.},

   abstract = {Climate models (CM) are used to evaluate the impact of climate change on the risk of floods and heavy precipitation events. However, these numerical simulators produce outputs with low spatial resolution that exhibit difficulties representing precipitation events accurately. This is mainly due to computational limitations on the spatial resolution used when simulating multi-scale weather dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using input data from a reanalysis product, that is comparable to a climate model’s output, but can be directly related to precipitation observations at a given time and location. Further, our input excludes local precipitation, but includes model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable and generalizable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We also propose a non-stochastic variant of the conditional-continuous (CC) loss function to capture the zero-skewed patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our models, trained with our CC loss, consistently attain lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in precipitation downscaling and outperform a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various data formulation strategies, for the training and test sets, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.},

However, downscaling of temporal sequences, extremes in daily precipitation, and handling of nonstationary precipitation in future conditions are considered common challenges for most statistical downscaling methods. This study reviewed the above key challenges in statistical downscaling and proposed potential solutions. Ten weather stations located across the globe were used as proof of concept. The use of a stochastic Markov chain to generate daily precipitation occurrences is an effective approach to simulate the temporal sequence of precipitation. Also, the downscaling of precipitation extremes can be achieved by adjusting the skewness coefficient of a probability distribution, as they are highly correlated. Nonstationarity in precipitation downscaling can be handled by adjusting parameters of a probability distribution according to future precipitation change signals projected by climate models. The perspectives proposed in this study are of great significance in using climate model outputs for assessing local and site-specific climate change impacts, especially on future food security.},

   abstract = {Water is fundamental to the life on Earth and its phase transition between the gaseous, liquid, and solid states dominates the behavior of the weather/climate/ecological system. Precipitation, which converts atmospheric water vapor into rain and snow, is central to the global water cycle. It regulates the global energy balance through interactions with clouds and water vapor (the primary greenhouse gas), and also shapes global winds and dynamic transport through latent heat release. Surface precipitation affects soil moisture, ocean salinity, and land hydrology, thus linking fast atmospheric processes to the slower components of the climate system. Precipitation is also the primary source of freshwater in the world, which is facing an emerging freshwater crisis in many regions. Accurate and timely knowledge of global precipitation is essential for understanding the behavior of the global water cycle, improving freshwater management, and advancing predictive capabilities of high-impact weather events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and landslides. With limited rainfall networks on land and the impracticality of making extensive rainfall measurements over oceans, a comprehensive description of the space and time variability of global precipitation can only be achieved from the vantage point of space. This presentation will examine current capabilities in space-borne rainfall measurements, highlight scientific and practical benefits derived from these observations to date, and provide an overview of the multi-national Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission scheduled to be launched in the early next decade.},

   abstract = {Machine learning is an evolving branch of computational algorithms that are designed to emulate human intelligence by learning from the surrounding environment. They are considered the working horse in the new era of the so-called big data. Techniques based on machine learning have been applied successfully in diverse fields ranging from pattern recognition, computer vision, spacecraft engineering, finance, entertainment, and computational biology to biomedical and medical applications. More than half of the patients with cancer receive ionizing radiation (radiotherapy) as part of their treatment, and it is the main treatment modality at advanced stages of local disease. Radiotherapy involves a large set of processes that not only span the period from consultation to treatment but also extend beyond that to ensure that the patients have received the prescribed radiation dose and are responding well. The degrees of the complexity of these processes can vary and may involve several stages of sophisticated human-machine interactions and decision making, which would naturally invite the use of machine learning algorithms into optimizing and automating these processes including but not limited to radiation physics quality assurance, contouring and treatment planning, image-guided radiotherapy, respiratory motion management, treatment response modeling, and outcomes prediction. The ability of machine learning algorithms to learn from current context and generalize into unseen tasks would allow improvements in both the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy practice leading to better outcomes.},

Objetivo: Evaluar efectos de la cosecha de café de frutos maduros y verdes sobre la calidad física y organoléptica del café arábigo. Materiales y métodos: El estudio se realizó en el 2018, en seis fincas cafetaleras en el cantón Jipijapa, provincia de Manabí, donde se evaluaron cuatro tratamientos en proporciones de 100% maduro; 75% maduro+25% verde; 50% maduro+50% verde; 25% maduro+75% verde, con 6 repeticiones. El beneficio del café se hizo por la vía seca. Los análisis físicos y organolépticos de las 24 muestras de café fueron analizados en el laboratorio de calidad de (ANECAFE). Las variables de calidad física del grano determinadas fueron: defectos, tamaño, rendimiento y densidad. Las características organolépticas evaluadas a través del protocolo de la Asociación de Cafés Especiales SCA fueron: fragancia-aroma, sabor, sabor residual, acidez, cuerpo, uniformidad, balance, taza limpia, dulzor, y el puntaje del catador. Se realizó el análisis de varianza (ADEVA) y separación de medias con la prueba de tukey al (p&lt;0.05). Resultados: permitieron establecer en la calidad física del grano en frutos cosechados inmaduros un mayor número de defectos, disminución del tamaño, rendimiento y densidad en relación a frutos cosechados 100% maduros. Las características organolépticas fueron afectadas negativamente en las tazas con café inmaduro con expresiones de aromas y sabores extraños, herbáceos, astringentes, agrios, ásperos y vinagre a diferencia de cafés con frutos seleccionados 100% maduro con atributos frutales, achocolatados, cítricos y panela. Conclusiones: La calidad física del café en frutos cosechados inmaduros presentaron un mayor número en el tratamiento 25% café maduro + 75% café verde el mayor registro de defectos físicos con el 73,1%, además de disminución en el tamaño, rendimiento y densidad del grano en relación a frutos cosechados 100% maduros.},

This enables EXA-GP to utilize the full suite of optimizations provided by EXAMM, such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, island based populations with re-population events, as well as Lamarckian weight inheritance and backpropagation for optimization of constant values. Results show that EXA-GP's evolved genetic programs achieve the same levels of accuracy as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) evolved by EXAMM, while at the same time being more explainable. EXA-GP's genetic programs are also computationally less complex than EXAMM's RNNs, suggesting that GP operations may actually be more effective than gated recurrent memory cells for time series forecasting. We also show that EXAMM and EXA-GP outperform state-of-the-art GP and recurrent CGPANN algorithms which struggle on these benchmarks.},

   abstract = {For effective and reliable management of water resources, the accurate forecasting of precipitation patterns is highly essential. The precipitation process is a complex hydrological component that is influenced by several hydro-meteorological variables, and it is varied from one region to another. In this study, the performance of coupled and standalone data intelligence models including wavelet artificial neural network (WANN), wavelet gene expressing programming (WGEP), artificial neural networks (ANN), and gene expressing programming (GEP) is undertaken for precipitation forecasting at four stations located in Iran (i.e., Ardabil, Khalkhal, Meshginshahr, and Parsabad). In this regard, monthly precipitation data are utilized from 1997 to 2016. The developed forecasting models are constructed using correlated lag time information. Two statistical performance metrics: coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square errors (RMSE), are calculated for forecasting accuracy inspection. The obtained results indicated the capacity of the WANN coupled model as a superior forecasting model compared with the other data intelligence models. This was observed at the four investigated meteorological stations. However, the potential of the discrete wavelet transform has also demonstrated an enhancement in the predictability performance of the GEP model. This is indicating the capability of the pre-processing data time series as a prior stage for the forecasting process. Further, the results evidence the capability of the WANN coupled model in capturing the peak values of the precipitation. Overall, the applied coupled data intelligence model provided a significant contribution to the precipitation forecasting at this region contributing to the base knowledge of water resources engineering.},

State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, renowned for their skill in learning accurate patterns within large and complex datasets, appear well suited to the task of precipitation estimation, given the ample amount of high-resolution satellite data. In this study, the effectiveness of applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) together with the infrared (IR) and water vapor (WV) channels from geostationary satellites for estimating precipitation rate is explored. The proposed model performances are evaluated during summer 2012 and 2013 over central CONUS at the spatial resolution of 0.088 and at an hourly time scale. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)–Cloud Classiﬁcation System (CCS), which is an operational satellite-based product, and PERSIANN–Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (PERSIANN-SDAE) are employed as baseline models. Results demonstrate that the proposed model (PERSIANN-CNN) provides more accurate rainfall estimates compared to the baseline models at various temporal and spatial scales. Speciﬁcally, PERSIANN-CNN outperforms PERSIANN-CCS (and PERSIANN-SDAE) by 54% (and 23%) in the critical success index (CSI), demonstrating the detection skills of the model. Furthermore, the root-meansquare error (RMSE) of the rainfall estimates with respect to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Stage IV gauge–radar data, for PERSIANN-CNN was lower than that of PERSIANN-CCS (PERSIANN-SDAE) by 37% (14%), showing the estimation accuracy of the proposed model.},

The current core of this system is an adaptive Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) model that estimates rainfall rates using infrared satellite imagery and groundsurface information. The model was initially calibrated over the Japanese Islands using remotely sensed infrared data collected by the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) and ground-based data collected by the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS). The model was then validated for both the Japanese Islands (using GMS and AMeDAS data) and the Florida peninsula (using GOES-8 and NEXRAD data). An adaptive procedure is used to recursively update the network parameters when ground-based data are available. This feature dramatically improves the estimation performance in response to the diverse precipitation characteristics of different geographical regions and time of year. The model can also be successfully updated using only spatially and/or temporally limited observation data such as ground-based rainfall measurements. Another important feature is a procedure that provides insights into the functional relationships between the input variables and output rainfall rate.},

   abstract = {Urban microclimate prediction is crucial for various fields, including Building Performance Simulation (BPS), outdoor thermal comfort, building life cycle, and residential health. Existing methods involve using classical weather file data, such as Typical Meteorological Years (TMY), or machine learning techniques for time-based forecasting. However, the incorporation of both spatial and temporal dimensions and land use/land cover (LULC) data is seldom considered. This paper proposes a novel approach to predict microclimate: the GeoLSTM-Kriging model, which is applicable for fine-scale microclimate prediction within a few hundred meters around weather stations. The Geo-layer processes and learns from LULC data, the LSTM layer learns from historical data, and the Kriging layer extracts spatial distance information. This comprehensive combination integrates spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions, providing accurate results with higher spatial resolution (1 m × 1 m) and shorter time intervals (10 min). These prediction results were achieved by employing statistical downscaling calculation and utilizing data from 14 weather stations located within our university campus. Upon the analysis of these prediction results, we found that the proposed model can accurately predict temperature and humidity at high spatial and temporal resolution. Compared to traditional interpolation models, the RMSE of temperature decreases from 1.59 ◦C to 0.64 ◦C, and the RMSE of relative humidity (RH) decreases from 7.70 to 3.23. A thorough analysis of the model prediction results reveals the varied impacts of different LULC features on microclimate predictions, highlighting the value of the proposed model and the importance of incorporating LULC data.},

The model in­ tegrates ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network) for forecasting the reconstructed components, subsequently combining their outputs. In terms of spatio-temporal data, the study employs prediction models including the spatio-temporal cube, spatiotemporal hotspot analysis integrated with empirical kriging, and local outlier analysis to examine spatial dis­ tribution. The model’s predictive performance is validated from three perspectives: statistical characteristics of the indicators, comparison between predicted and observed values through prediction curve plots, and box plots. The results demonstrate that the combined SSA-VMD-ARIMA-BiLSTM model significantly enhances prediction accuracy compared to single models, as exemplified by its application in Changchun City. The model achieved an R2 of 0.938 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.047 in drought prediction, outperforming the single ARIMA model (R2: 0.636, RMSE: 0.709) and the BiLSTM model (R2: 0.514, RMSE: 0.901). Additionally, across the entire province, the model’s R2, MAE, and RMSE are 0.82, 0.15, and 0.083, respectively, suggesting that the model exhibits not only high prediction accuracy but also a degree of generalizability. Furthermore, the results from the spatio-temporal cube, spatio-temporal hotspot analysis, and local outlier analysis demonstrate the method’s high accuracy and stability in predicting both short-term and long-term droughts. Particularly in shortterm drought prediction, the model effectively captures the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of shortterm meteorological droughts. This study offers new methodological support for enhancing the early warning capabilities of drought risk in Jilin Province, providing a robust foundation for addressing the challenges posed by climate change. The findings not only address certain shortcomings in current drought prediction research but also introduce new methodologies and perspectives for future studies.},

   abstract = {Energy consumption forecasting is essential for energy system integration and management. However, existing studies mainly focus on temporal features of energy consumption, which neglects the spatial correlation of variables with time information. Capturing the spatio-temporal relationships helps to improve forecasting ac­ curacy and further promote energy dispatch. To tackle this problem, an explainable Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory forecasting model is employed to effectively predict the total energy con­ sumption by capturing the spatial and temporal features of multivariate time series. In the model, the autoen­ coder is used to achieve the nonlinear dimensionality reduction and transfer the data to a low-dimensional space. Furthermore, a Convolutional Neural Network is used to extract more effective features from the decoded data, and long short-term memory is employed to identify the temporal dependencies between extracted features and total energy consumption. Shapley additive explanation is introduced to interpret the outputs of the black-box model. The superior performance of the proposed method with high accuracy and good adaptability is veri­ fied by the comparisons with conventional forecasting models. This method provides an insight into the regional energy consumption analyzing contributions of weather variables to energy consumption, which helps admin­ isters in understanding regional energy performance for enhancing energy efficiency.},

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unknown linear or nonlinear unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. In this paper, we extend recently introduced identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.},

The study assessed the application of a combination of Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and human observation approaches to understand spatio-temporal dynamics of drought in Zvishavane District. A mixed methods research design supported by both qualitative and quantitative approaches was adopted. GIS and remote sensing, questionnaire, interviews and focus group discussions were adopted for data collection. ArcMap 10.5, Microsoft excel 2013 and SPI Generator software were used for data analysis. Findings indicated that human observation, VCI and SPI can detect the temporal distribution of severe-extreme droughts. Based on finding, SPI proved difficult to use for analyzing the spatial distribution of drought at district level where only one rain gauge exist for the district. Human perceptions and VCI were confirmed to be in agreement when detecting spatial distribution of severe-extreme droughts at district level. Findings showed that humans tend to forget or fail to notice the spatial and temporal distribution of moderate drought which VCI proved to be effective in detecting. A hybrid method of drought monitoring which incorporates remote sensing indices, meteorological indices and human per­ ceptions is encouraged to ensure a comprehensive analysis of drought.},

This involves having an accurate and efficient forecast of future SST to ensure early detection and response in time to these events. Deep learning algorithms have become popular in SST prediction recently, although directly obtaining optimal pre­ diction results from historical observation data is not simple. In this paper, we propose STA-SST, a new deep learning approach for forecasting SST, by combining the temporal dependencies of SST using the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model, spatial features extracted from the convolution layer, and relevant information from the attention mechanism. To assess how well the Attention-BiLSTM with convolution layer predicts SST, we conducted a case study in the Moroccan Sea, concentrating on five different areas. The proposed model was compared against alternative forecasting models, including LSTM, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest (RF). The experimental results show that STA-STT produces noticeably the best prediction results and is a solid choice for field implementation.},

To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) model for an accurate wetland classification using seasonal data. The ST-ViT model was trained using multi-seasonal Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data acquired during the spring, summer, and fall of 2020 in a study area located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The performance of the ST-ViT model was evaluated against the validation dataset, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.950 and F1-score (F1) of 0.934, outperforming other deep learning models such as random forest (RF), hybrid spectral network (HybridSN), etc. The model demonstrated strong classification capabilities among most wetland classes, with some challenges in distinguishing between spectrally similar classes like bogs and fens. Moreover, the integration of spatio-temporal features enabled the reduction of feature mixing between wetland classes, particularly during different seasons. The ST-ViT model provides an accurate wetland distribution map in different seasons, supporting critical decision-making processes related to wetland conservation and environmental monitoring.},

Here, we reviewed ∼230 statistical crop modeling studies for major crops and summarized recent progress in estimating climate change impacts on crop yields.

A 1 °C warming decreased the yields by 7.5 ± 5.3% (maize), 6.0 ± 3.3% (wheat), 6.8 ± 5.9% (soybean), and 1.2 ±5.2% (rice) across the world, but spatial heterogeneity was noticeable, due partly to asymmetric nonlinear crop responses to temperature (e.g., warming-induced gains in cold regions). Yield responses to precipitation were not consistent across the studies or geographical areas. On average, climate explained 37% of yield variability. We also observed a methodological shift from linear regression to machine learning (e.g., explainable AI and interpretable machine learning), which on average reduced predictve errors by 44%. Furthermore, we discussed the opportunities and challenges facing statistical crop modeling, such as ensemble modeling, physics-informed machine learning, spatiotemporal heterogeneity in crop responses, climate extremes, extrapolation under novel climates, and the confounding from technology, management, CO2, and O3.},

In addition, the project attempts to identify the most efﬁcient model averaging method and the optimal number of models to include in the weighting scheme. In order to address the ﬁrst objective, streamﬂow was simulated using four lumped hydrological models (HSAMI, HMETS, MOHYSE and GR4J-6), each of which were calibrated with three different objective functions on 429 watersheds. The resulting 12 hydrographs (4 models Â 3 metrics) were weighted and combined with the help of 9 averaging methods which are the simple arithmetic mean (SAM), Akaike information criterion (AICA), Bates–Granger (BGA), Bayes information criterion (BICA), Bayesian model averaging (BMA), Granger–Ramanathan average variant A, B and C (GRA, GRB and GRC) and the average by SCE-UA optimization (SCA). The same weights were then applied to the hydrographs in validation mode, and the Nash–Sutcliffe Efﬁciency metric was measured between the averaged and observed hydrographs. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the accuracy of weighted methods to that of individual models. A Kruskal–Wallis test and a multi-objective optimization algorithm were then used to identify the most efﬁcient weighted method and the optimal number of models to integrate. Results suggest that the GRA, GRB, GRC and SCA weighted methods perform better than the individual members. Model averaging from these four methods were superior to the best of the individual members in 76% of the cases. Optimal combinations on all watersheds included at least one of each of the four hydrological models. None of the optimal combinations included all members of the ensemble of 12 hydrographs. The Granger–Ramanathan average variant C (GRC) is recommended as the best compromise between accuracy, speed of execution, and simplicity.},

   abstract = {Multi-model ensemble strategy is a means to exploit the diversity of skillful predictions from diﬀerent models. This paper studies the use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) scheme to develop more skillful and reliable probabilistic hydrologic predictions from multiple competing predictions made by several hydrologic models. BMA is a statistical procedure that infers consensus predictions by weighing individual predictions based on their probabilistic likelihood measures, with the better performing predictions receiving higher weights than the worse performing ones. Furthermore, BMA provides a more reliable description of the total predictive uncertainty than the original ensemble, leading to a sharper and better calibrated probability density function (PDF) for the probabilistic predictions. In this study, a nine-member ensemble of hydrologic predictions was used to test and evaluate the BMA scheme. This ensemble was generated by calibrating three diﬀerent hydrologic models using three distinct objective functions. These objective functions were chosen in a way that forces the models to capture certain aspects of the hydrograph well (e.g., peaks, mid-ﬂows and low ﬂows). Two sets of numerical experiments were carried out on three test basins in the US to explore the best way of using the BMA scheme. In the ﬁrst set, a single set of BMA weights was computed to obtain BMA predictions, while the second set employed multiple sets of weights, with distinct sets corresponding to diﬀerent ﬂow intervals. In both sets, the streamﬂow values were transformed using Box–Cox transformation to ensure that the probability distribution of the prediction errors is approximately Gaussian. A split sample approach was used to obtain and validate the BMA predictions. The test results showed that BMA scheme has the advantage of generating more skillful and equally reliable probabilistic predictions than original ensemble. The performance of the expected BMA predictions in terms of daily root mean square error (DRMS) and daily absolute mean error (DABS) is generally superior to that of the best individual predictions. Furthermore, the BMA predictions employing multiple sets of weights are generally better than those using single set of weights.},

To this end, we analyze the hypothesis stability of stacking, bag-stacking, and dag-stacking and establish a connection between bag-stacking and weighted bagging. We show that the hypothesis stability of stacking is a product of the hypothesis stability of each of the base models and the combiner. Moreover, in bag-stacking and dag-stacking, the hypothesis stability depends on the sampling strategy used to generate the training set replicates. Our ﬁndings suggest that 1) subsampling and bootstrap sampling improve the stability of stacking, and 2) stacking improves the stability of both subbagging and bagging.},

Next, the SVD (singular value decomposition) algorithm is applied to decompose all selected inputs, thus capturing the most relevant oscillatory features more clearly; then, the monthly lagged data are incorporated into a random forest model to generate future precipitation anomalies. The proposed model is applied in four districts of Pakistan and benchmarked by means of a standalone kernel ridge regression (KRR) model that is integrated with NSGA-SVD (hybrid NSGA-SVD-KRR) and the NSGA-RF and NSGA-KRR baseline models.

   abstract = {Despite the massive diversity in the modeling requirements for practical hydrological applications, there remains a need to develop more reliable and intelligent expert systems used for real-time prediction purposes. The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model's internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Ens), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model's effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by Ens = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61–22.53%) and (8.26–8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.},

   abstract = {Rainfall is one of the most important meteorological phenomena that impacts many fields, including agriculture, energy, water resources management, and mining, among others. While machine learning (ML) models have shown great potential in rainfall forecasting as they perform well and sometimes better than some physical models, the complex physical processes involved in rainfall formation make single ML models insufficient for providing accurate rainfall estimates in most cases. Although there are comprehensive reviews of the performance evaluation of individual ML models in the literature, only a limited number of reviews exist that include hybrid models that specifically focus on rainfall forecasting. This paper presents an extensive review of the performance of hybrid ML models for rainfall forecasting. The vital information on the forecasting time scales, model inputs, and evaluation methods used for constructing these models has been analysed and discussed. The findings revealed that hybrid ML models composed by integrating data pre-processing techniques and optimisation algorithms may be a successful and efficient solution to enhance rainfall predictions at various timescales. Hybrid ML models used for rainfall predictions are capable of producing comparatively more accurate forecasts and reducing uncertainty for both short and longer lead times. Recent advances in physical-ML hybrid models for weather forecasting have also been highlighted. Overall, this review article provides useful information to researchers interested in developing early warning systems for precise and timely rainfall forecasting.},

   abstract = {In machine learning (ML), ensemble methods-such as bagging, boosting, and stacking-are widely-established approaches that regularly achieve top-notch predictive performance. Stacking (also called 'stacked generalization') is an ensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at least one layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of those models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the predictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can be a cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormous space of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and features that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from, and instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models) that perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we present a knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use of visualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Our system, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics, managing data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data set, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring the predictive performance. In consequence, our proposed tool helps users to decide between distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting stack by removing overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability and effectiveness of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-world healthcare data set and a collection of data related to sentiment/stance detection in texts. Finally, the tool has been evaluated through interviews with three ML experts.},

Given the deficiencies of single models in processing various patterns and relationships latent in data, hybrid approaches have been known as promising techniques to achieve more accurate results for time series modeling and forecasting. Therefore, a rapid development has been evolved in time series forecasting fields in order to access accurate results. While, numerous review papers have been concentrated on the use of hybrid models and their advantages in improving forecasting accuracy versus individual models in wide variety of areas, no study is concerned to categorize and review papers from the structural point of view in numerous developed studies. The main goal of this paper is to analyze hybrid structures by surveying more than 150 papers employed various hybrid models in time series modeling and forecasting domains. In this paper, the classification of hybrid models is made based on three main combination structures: parallel, series, and parallel–series. Then, reviewed papers are analyzed comprehensively with respect to their specific features of employed hybrid structure. Through reviewed articles, it can be observed that combined methods are viable and accurate approaches for time series forecasting and also the parallel–series hybrid structure can obtain more accurate and promising results than other those hybrid structures. Besides this paper provides the viable research directions for each hybrid structure to help the researchers in time series forecasting area.},

Then, we formulate the true and generalization errors of the model for both training and validation/test instances where we make use of the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). We define overfitting, underfitting, and generalization using the obtained true and generalization errors. We introduce cross validation and two well-known examples which are $K$-fold and leave-one-out cross validations. We briefly introduce generalized cross validation and then move on to regularization where we use the SURE again. We work on both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ norm regularizations. Then, we show that bootstrap aggregating (bagging) reduces the variance of estimation. Boosting, specifically AdaBoost, is introduced and it is explained as both an additive model and a maximum margin model, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM). The upper bound on the generalization error of boosting is also provided to show why boosting prevents from overfitting. As examples of regularization, the theory of ridge and lasso regressions, weight decay, noise injection to input/weights, and early stopping are explained. Random forest, dropout, histogram of oriented gradients, and single shot multi-box detector are explained as examples of bagging in machine learning and computer vision. Finally, boosting tree and SVM models are mentioned as examples of boosting.},

The contribution of monthly rainfall is important in agriculture and hydrological tasks. This paper proposes two data-driven models, namely biogeography-based extreme learning machine (BBO-ELM) and deep neural network (DNN), to predict one, two, and three month-ahead rainfall over India (All-India and six other homogeneous regions). Three other data-driven models called ELM, genetic algorithm (GA)-based ELM, and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based ELM are used to compare the performance of the proposed models. Firstly, partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is applied in all datasets to select the optimal number of lags for input to the models. Secondly, the wavelet-based data pre-processing technique is applied in selected optimal lags and feed to the proposed models for achieving higher prediction performance. To investigate the performance of proposed models, a non-parametric statistical test, Anderson–Darling’ Normality test, is performed in all India dataset. The wavelet-based proposed hybrid models show better prediction capability compared to optimal lag-based proposed models. This study shows the successful application of time-series data using proposed techniques (optimal lags-based BBO-ELM and wavelet-based DNN) in the hydrological field which may be used for risk mitigation from dreadful natural events.},

In this study, a novel hybrid method is proposed for monthly runoff prediction in Mangla watershed in northern Pakistan by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) with extreme learning machine (ELM) as ELM-PSOGWO. The proposed method was compared with the standalone ELM, hybrid of ELM-PSO, and binary hybrid PSOGSA (hybrid of PSO with gravitational search algorithm) methods. Monthly precipitation and runoff data were used as inputs to the models to examine their accuracy in terms of different statistical indexes. Test results showed that the proposed ELM-PSOGWO provided more accurate results than the standalone ELM, hybrid ELM-PSO, ELM-GWO nd binary hybrid PSOGSA methods in monthly runoff prediction. ELM-PSOGWO reduced the RMSE in prediction of ELM, ELM-PSO, ELM-GWO and ELM-PSOGSA by 38.2, 22.8, 22.4 and 16.7%, respectively. The PSO and GWO based ELM models also performed better than standalone ELM models, with an improvement in RMSE by 19.9 to 20.3%, respectively. Results also showed that adding precipitation as input enhanced the prediction accuracy of models. ELM-PSOGWO was also able to provide more precise estimates of peak runoff with the lowest absolute mean relative error compared to other methods.

By amalgamating multiple models, it aims to generate enhanced results, based on the concept that increasing the diversity of simulations and reweighting them improve the accuracy. New hydrological insights for the region: Particularly in regions like Cork City, which have experienced heavy precipitation events, accurate prediction is vital for informed decision-making. Here, monthly precipitation simulations from 35 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) models of Phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) were utilized. The simulations considered the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, for the hindcast and forecast periods of 1990–2014 and 2076–2100, respectively. Using the proposed technique, the results demonstrate the superior performance of the approach in reconstructing precipitation timeseries from NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 simulations, particularly in dealing with high precipitation intensities, while maintaining accuracy for low intensities. Additionally, the projections indicate that precipitation is expected to decrease from 122.88 during 1990–2014–115.67 (SSP1–2.6) and 118.71 mm/month (SSP5-8.5) in 2076–2100.

Of all the various hazards, drought prediction is challenging as it lacks a universal definition and is getting adverse with climate change impacting drought events both spatially and temporally. The problem becomes more complex as drought occurrence is dependent on a multitude of factors ranging from hydro-meteorological to climatic variables. A paradigm shift happened in this field when it was found that the inclusion of climatic variables in the data-driven prediction model improves the accuracy. However, this understanding has been primarily using statistical metrics used to measure the model accuracy. The present work tries to explore this finding using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model. The explainable deep learning model development and comparative analysis were performed using known understandings drawn from physical-based models. The work also tries to explore how the model achieves specific results at different spatio-temporal intervals, enabling us to understand the local interactions among the predictors for different drought conditions and drought periods. The drought index used in the study is Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) at 12 month scales applied for five different regions in New South Wales, Australia, with the explainable algorithm being SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The conclusions drawn from SHAP plots depict the importance of climatic variables at a monthly scale and varying ranges of annual scale.

SPI-1, SPI-3, and SPI-6-month time scales drought data calculated from the monthly precipitation data of the Sakarya Meteorology Station between 1960 and 2020 were taken as input data in the LSTM model. SPI drought data were used between 1960 and 2005 as training data and 2006–2020 as test data. Drought at t+1 output time was predicted using SPI values at t, t-1, t-2, and t-3 lag times as input variables. In addition, the results were compared with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-extreme learning machine (ELM) hybrid model to understand the capabilities of the standalone LSTM prediction model. The LSTM model yielded the best results (MAE = 0.11, NSE = 0.97, R2 = 0.97) for the SPI-1-month time scale and the best results (MAE = 0.18, NSE = 0.92, R2 = 0.94) for 3-month time scale. The EMD-ELM hybrid model yielded the best results (MAE = 0.22, NSE = 0.95, R2 = 0.96) for the SPI-6-month time scale.

In this research, a new ultramodern complementary intelligent framework comprised of the SelectKbest feature selection (FS), Empirical Fourier Decomposition (EFD), and deep ensemble random vector functional link (Deep RVFL) was developed for multi-temporal monthly forecasting of short-term drought indicators for three and six months (SPEI3 and SPEI6) for two different very hot and semi-humid climate zones of Iran. For this purpose, the most influential time lags associated with each drought indicator were indicated using the SelectKbest FS in each zone. Afterwards, the individual SPEI signals were decomposed by the EFD technique imposing the most important lagged components to feed the ML approaches. Here, a new hybrid architecture deep learning model, namely a convolutional neural network coupled with a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-Bi-GRU) designed for multi-temporal drought forecasting in the next one-and three- months. Two advanced approaches, introducing the convolutional neural network coupled with bidirectional recurrent neural network (CNN-Bi-RNN), and Random vector function link (RVFL) were adopted to validate the main model (EFD-DeepRVFL) in complementary and standalone counterpart forms. The robustness of all the models was examined using several metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), reliability, and squared Chi-square Distance (SquD). The comprehensive assessment of the outcomes of hybrid schemes revealed that EFD-DeepRVFL owing to superior performance (R2|SPEI3(t + 1) = 0.953, R2|SPEI3(t + 3) = 0.837, R2|SPEI6(t + 1) = 0.962, and R2|SPEI6(t + 3) = 0.887) at Ahvaz station and (R2|SPEI3(t + 1) = 0.964, R2|SPEI3(t + 3) = 0.863, R2|SPEI6(t + 1) = 0.935, and R2|SPEI6(t + 3) = 0.839) at Kermanshah station outperformed the EFD-RVFL and CNN-Bi-RNN, respectively. The developed expert system provides early warning of drought conditions, as a decision-making tool, crop yield prediction, and water resources risk assessment.},

   abstract = {Precipitation is essential for crop production, water resource management, and other activities. Since precipitation has unpredictable sequential and seasonal characteristics, it is extremely difficult to forecast precipitation. Hence, a better forecasting model will lead to an early warning that minimizes the risk to life and property. Many approaches, such as statistical, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and hybrid algorithms, are used to build precipitation forecasting systems. Feature selection is especially important for selecting past values (lags) and to eliminate irrelevant and/or redundant features. The optimization algorithm helps identify correct time series lags because it does not make data assumptions. In this work, a hybrid long-term (1-month ahead) precipitation forecast model (ABR-LSO) is proposed by integrating the AdaBoostRegressor (ABR) with the Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) algorithm. Time series precipitation data for the period 1989–2019 for Idukki, Kerala, India. The ABR model considered 12 antecedent rainfall records as its input features and predicted the rainfall data for the next time step (t + 1), whereas the ABR-LSO hybrid model optimized the input features with LSO. The efficacy of the forecast models is evaluated using statistical indices like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). It has been noted that in models 1, 2, and 3, the LSO-ABR model produced good MAE above ABR model improvements of 5.08 %, 4 %, and 6.12 %, respectively. Precipitation forecasts will help the administrators devise disaster prevention mechanisms against flooding in the downstream areas.},

   abstract = {Reliable prediction of river discharge can contribute remarkably for flood control, water resources planning and management. In recent times, several machine learning (ML) models have been utilized to predict river discharge, revealing that their performances are superior to conventional statistical models. In this study, a new hybrid ML model was developed based on the hybridization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with improved Harris hawks optimization (IHHO) algorithm to apprehend the non-linear and linear constituents of monthly river discharge time series. Different climatological variables including precipitation (P), air temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), evapotranspiration (E) and hydrological variable i.e., water level of Mahanadi river basin in Odisha, India; were used for the model's development. To determine hyper-parameters of LSTM model, HHO, salp swarm algorithm (SSA), sine cosine optimization algorithm (SCO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms were integrated with LSTM. The performance of these models was statistically evaluated using Willmott Index (WI), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), PBIAS and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The obtained results revealed that the hybrid LSTM-IHHO model could generate more precise and reliable prediction compared to LSTM-HHO, LSTM-SSA, LSTM-SCO, LSTM-GWO, LSTM-PSO, and the standalone LSTM models. The LSTM-IHHO model performed superior prediction results with RMSE = 19.3658, WI = 0.9614, R2 = 0.9663, PBIAS = −3.5467 for Kantamal, RMSE = 19.9854, WI = 0.9608, R2 = 0.9657, PBIAS = 2.3665 for Kesinga, RMSE = 20.0019, WI = 0.9605, R2 = 0.96547, PBIAS = −0.351 for Salebhata and RMSE = 19.5321, WI = 0.961, R2 = 0.9659, PBIAS = −0.9264 for Sundergarh over the testing phase. LSTM-IHHO model was also capable of providing more specific estimates of peak discharge with lowest MAPE and RMSE compared to other methods. The proposed hybridized LSTM-IHHO model was extremely proficient in capturing linear and non-linear elements of the time series for forecasting river discharge events.},

   abstract = {Drought can cause great harm and loss, so accurate and efficient drought prediction has certain research significance. In previous studies, a single machine learning model is often used to predict the factors related to drought, such as precipitation and temperature, to indirectly explain the influence degree of drought, but the overall prediction accuracy is low, which can not fully and effectively predict the nonlinear and non-stationary drought characteristic information. In this paper, the variational modal decomposition model (VMD) is used to decompose the meteorological drought time series, and the convolution neural network (CNN) and the improved bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) are combined to construct the meteorological drought hybrid prediction model (VMD-CBiLSTM). The research results show that using VMD-CBiLSTM model to forecast the monthly daily evapotranspiration deficit index (DEDI) of three weather stations, compared with the results predicted by VMD-LSTM, VMD-BiLSTM and VMD-ARIMA models, the average prediction accuracy R2 is increased by 0.076, 0.034 and 0.328 respectively, and the average RMSE is decreased by 0.178, 0.094 and 1.373 respectively. Compared with single model, VMD-CBiLSTM can not only reduce the uncertainty of meteorological drought prediction caused by climate model heterogeneity, but also improve the accuracy of drought prediction in arid and semi-arid regions, which can provide reference for coping with drought occurrence and drought early warning in advance.},

   abstract = {In water resources engineering, streamflow estimation models are of great importance. The use of black box models in determining streamflow estimation is preferred because it saves time compared to deterministic models. In addition, the data needed is less in quality and quantity and has a lower transaction volume. Therefore, accurate flow estimation plays a crucial role in water resources planning, management, and sizing of water structures. This study aimed to forecast the monthly streamflow using particle swarm optimization, least-squares support-vector machine, and signal processing models. For this purpose, 575 monthly data between 1963-2010 were used in Sivas, and 622 monthly data between 1960-2011 were used in Kayseri. The model structure used past streamflow, temperature, and precipitation values as input. During the installation of hybrid models, the inputs are divided into subcomponents with three levels of discrete Meyer mother wavelet and presented to the LS-SVM model. The performance of the models was evaluated with the help of statistical indicators such as determination coefficient, mean absolute error, Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency, mean square error, Violin plots and visual Taylor diagrams. At the end of the study, EMD-LSSVM was the best streamflow estimation model at station 1501, and W-LSSVM was the most successful streamflow estimation model at station 1535. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Drought is a harmful natural disaster with various negative effects on many aspects of life. In this research, short-term meteorological droughts were predicted with hybrid machine learning models using monthly precipitation data (1960–2020 period) of Sakarya Meteorological Station, located in the northwest of Turkey. Standardized precipitation index (SPI), depending only on precipitation data, was used as the drought index, and 1-, 3-, and 6-month time scales for short-term droughts were considered. In the prediction models, drought index was predicted at t + 1 output variable by using t, t − 1, t − 2, and t − 3 input variables. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine regression (SVMR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms were employed as stand-alone machine learning methods. Variation mode decomposition (VMD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) were utilized as pre-processing techniques to create hybrid models. Six different performance criteria were used to assess model performance. The hybrid models used together with the pre-processing techniques were found to be more successful than the stand-alone models. Hybrid VMD-GPR model yielded the best results (NSE = 0.9345, OI = 0.9438, R2 = 0.9367) for 1-month time scale, hybrid VMD-GPR model (NSE = 0.9528, OI = 0.9559, R2 = 0.9565) for 3-month time scale, and hybrid DWT-ANN model (NSE = 0.9398, OI = 0.9483, R2 = 0.9450) for 6-month time scale. Considering the entire performance criteria, it was determined that the decomposition success of VMD was higher than DWT and EMD. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {The sustainability of artificial sand-binding vegetation is determined by the water balance between evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation in desert regions. Consequently, accurately estimating ET is a critical prerequisite for determing the types and spatial distribution of artificial vegetation in different sandy areas. For this purpose, a novel hybrid estimation model was proposed to estimate monthly ET by coupling the deep learning long short term memory (LSTM) with variational mode decomposition (VMD) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) (i.e., VMD-WOA-LSTM) to estimate the monthly ET in the southeast margins of Tengger Desert. The superiority of LSTM was selected due to its capability of automatically extracting the nonlinear and nonstationary features from sequential data, WOA was employed to optimize the hyperparameters of LSTM, and VMD was used to extract the intrinsic traits of ET time series. The estimating results of VMD-WOA-LSTM has been compared with actual ET and estimation of other hybrid models in terms of standard performance metrics. The results reveale that VMD-WOA-LSTM provide more accurate and reliable estimating results than that of LSTM, the support vector machine (SVM), and the variants of those models. Therefore, VMD-WOA-LSTM could be recommended as an essential auxiliary method to estimate ET in desert regions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The availability of a climate database is an essential requirement for modeling and mapping hydrological and environmental processes. Regardless of the nature and structure of these models, most of them require a complete and reliable dataset on a spatiotemporal basis. Unfortunately, the measurement of hydrological variables (precipitation, flow, etc.) can be affected by systematic errors, gaps and random data. The watershed of Seybouse located in the North-East of Algeria, has a network that has gaps in the monthly data with an average error percentage of 20.46% over the period of 1970–2008 on all the stations in operation. The current study combines support vector regression, artificial neural networks, boosted tree, bagged tree, gaussian processes regression and linear regression techniques with empirical mode decomposition and discrete wavelet transform techniques to fill the missing precipitation gaps. This study aims to determine which kernel function, regression type, tree and network structure and data decomposition technique will produce the best outputs in predicting missing rainfall. For this purpose, it aims to comprehensively evaluate various soft computing and signal processing models and use strengthened hybrid approaches by combining them. While modeling, 70% of the data was used for training and the rest for testing. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R2), Taylor diagram and Violin plots were used to find the best model. As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that the SVM model produced superior outputs compared to other machine learning models. The single LSVM model had an R2 value of 0.78, RMSE of 8.18, and MAE of 5.90. The W-LSVM model had an R2 value of 0.78, RMSE of 8.10, and MAE of 5.90. The EMD-CGSVM model had an R2 value of 0.69, RMSE of 10.43, and MAE of 7.10. These results indicate that the W-LSVM models provided the most accurate rainfall forecast outputs. The results showed that the wavelet-based linear support vector regression model in precipitation prediction is the most successful artificial intelligence model. Finally, using the W-LSVM model to predict rainfall in the study area can significantly improve water resources management and flood strategies and help optimize water use and structures. © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {Precise multi-time scales prediction of groundwater level is essential for water resources planning and management. However, credible and reliable predicting results are hard to achieve even to extensively applied artificial intelligence (AI) models considering the uncontrollable error, indefinite inputs and unneglectable uncertainty during the modelling process. The AI model ensembled with the data pretreatment technique, the input selection method, or uncertainty analysis has been successfully used to tackle this issue, whereas studies about the comprehensive deterministic and uncertainty analysis of hybrid models in groundwater level forecast are rarely reported. In this study, a novel hybrid predictive model combining the variational mode decomposition (VMD) data pretreatment technique, Boruta input selection method, bootstrap based uncertainty analysis, and the extreme learning machine (ELM) model named VBELM was developed for 1-, 2-and 3month ahead groundwater level prediction in a typical arid oasis area of northwestern China. The historical observed monthly groundwater level, precipitation and temperature data were used as inputs to train and test the model. Specifically, the VMD was used to decompose all the input-outputs into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), the Boruta method was applied to determine input variables, and the ELM was employed to forecast the value of each IMF. In order to ascertain the efficiency of the proposed VBELM model, the performance of the coupled model (VELM) hybridizing VMD with ELM algorithm and the single ELM model were estimated in comparison. The results indicate that the VBELM performed best, while the single ELM model performed the worst among the three models. Furthermore, the VBELM model presented lower uncertainty than the VELM model with more observed groundwater level values falling inside the confidence interval. In summary, the VBELM model demonstrated an excellent performance for both certainty and uncertainty analyses, and can serve as an effective tool for multi-scale groundwater level forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Hydrological droughts are largely analyzed using the truncation level approach to represent the desired flow condition such as the median, mean, or any other flow quantile of an annual, monthly, or weekly flow sequence. The quantification of hydrologic droughts is accomplished through indices, such as the standardized streamflow index (SSI) in tandem with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) commonly used in meteorological droughts. The runs of deficits in the SSI sequence below the truncation level are treated as drought episodes, and thus, the theory of runs forms an essential tool for analysis. The parameters of significance from the modeling perspective of hydrological droughts (or tantamount to streamflow droughts in this paper) are the longest duration and the largest magnitude over a desired return period of T-year (or month or week) of the streamflow sequences. It is to be stressed that the magnitude component of the hydrological drought is of paramount importance for the design and operation of water resource storage systems such as reservoirs. The time scales chosen for the hydrologic drought analysis range from daily to annual, but for most applications, a monthly scale is deemed appropriate. For modeling the aforesaid parameters, several methodologies are in vogue, i.e., the empirical fitting of the historical drought sequences through a known probability density function (pdf), extreme number theorem, Markov chain analysis, log-linear, copulas, entropy-based analyses, and machine learning (ML)-based methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN), wavelet transform (WT), support vector machines (SVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), and hybrid methods involving entropy, copulas, and machine learning-based methods. The forecasting of the hydrologic drought is rigorously conducted through machine learning-based methodologies. However, the traditional stochastic methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), copulas, and entropy-based methods are still popular. New techniques for flow simulation are based on copula and entropy-based concepts and machine learning methodologies such as ANN, WT, SVM, etc. The simulated flows could be used for deriving drought parameters in consonance with traditional Monte Carlo methods of data generation. Efforts are underway to use hydrologic drought models for reservoir sizing across rivers. The ML methods whilst combined in the hybrid form hold promise in drought forecasting for better management of existing water resources during the drought periods. Data mining and pre-processing techniques are expected to play a significant role in hydrologic drought modeling and forecasting in future. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {A crucial necessity in integrated water resource management is flood forecasting. Climate forecasts, specifically flood prediction, comprise multifaceted tasks as they are dependant on several parameters for predicting the dependant variable, which varies from time to time. Calculation of these parameters also changes with geographical location. From the time when Artificial Intelligence was first introduced to the field of hydrological modelling and prediction, it has produced enormous attention in research aspects for additional developments to hydrology. This study investigates the usability of support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and integration of SVM with particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM) models for flood forecasting. Performance of SVM solely depends on correct assortment of parameters. So, PSO method is employed in selecting SVM parameters. Monthly river flow discharge for a period of 1969 - 2018 of BP ghat and Fulertal gauging sites from Barak River flowing through Barak valley in Assam, India were used. For obtaining optimum results, different input combinations of Precipitation (Pt), temperature (Tt), solar radiation (Sr), humidity (Ht), evapotranspiration loss (El) were assessed. The model results were compared utilizing coefficient of determination (R2) root mean squared error (RMSE), and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE). The most important results are highlighted below. • First, the inclusion of five meteorological parameters improved the forecasting accuracy of the hybrid model. • Second, model comparison specifies that hybrid PSO-SVM model executed superior performance with RMSE- 0.04962 and NSE- 0.99334 compared to BPNN and SVM models for monthly flood discharge forecasting. • Third, applied optimization algorithm has easy implementation, simple theory, and high computational efficacy. Results revealed that PSO-SVM could be utilised as an improved alternate method for flood forecasting as it provided a higher degree of reliability and accurateness. © 2023 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {This study aimed to forecast dam inflows and subsequently predict its capability in producing HEPP using machine learning and evolutionary optimization techniques. Mahabad Dam, located in the northwest of Iran and recognized as one of the nation’s key dams, served as a case study. First, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were employed to predict dam inflows, with optimization of parameters achieved through Harris hawks optimization (HHO), a robust optimization technique. The data of temperature, precipitation, and dam inflow over a 24-year period on a monthly basis, incorporating various lag times, were used to train these machines. Then, HEPP from the dam was predicted using temperature, precipitation, dam inflow, and dam evaporation as input variables. The models were applied to data covering the years 2000 to 2020. The results of the first part indicated both hybrid models (HHO-ANFIS and HHO-SVR) improved the prediction performance compared to the single models. Based on the results of Taylor’s diagram and the error evaluation criteria, the HHO-ANFIS hybrid model (RMSE, MAE, and NSE of 3.90, 2.41, and 0.86, respectively) exerted better performance than HHO-SVR (RMSE, MAE, and NSE of 4.39, 2.70, and 0.86, respectively). The results of the second part showed that using the HHO algorithm to optimize single models (RMSE, MAE, and NSE of 0.2, 10, and 0.90, respectively) predicted HEPP better than single models (RMSE, MAE, and NSE of 0.2, 10, and 0.90, respectively). The results of Taylor’s diagram also showed that the HHO-ANFIS model exerted better performance. The findings of this study indicated the promising performance of machine learning models optimized by metaheuristic algorithms in the simultaneous prediction of dam inflows and HEPP in multi-purpose dams for better management and allocation of surface water resources. © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {Drought, as a phenomenon that causes significant damage to agriculture and water resources, has increased across the globe due to climate change. Hence, scientists are attracted to developing drought prediction models for mitigation strategies. Different drought indices (DIs) have been proposed for drought monitoring during the past few decades, most of which are probabilistic, highly stochastic, and non-linear. The present study inspected the capability of various machine learning (ML) models, including artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) as original predictive models and optimized by two selected algorithms, namely, particle swarm optimization (SVR-PSO) and response surface method (SVR-RSM) to predict the meteorological drought indices of standardized precipitation index (SPI), percentage of normal precipitation (PN), effective drought index (EDI), and modified China-Z index (MCZI) on a monthly time scale. A novel model named SVR-RMS is introduced by using two calibrating processes given from RSM with two inputs and the SVR by predicted data handled with RSM given from the first calibrating procedure. For evaluating the models, different meteorological input variables in the period 1981–2020 were considered from 11 synoptic stations in arid and semi-arid climates of Iran, which frequently experience droughts. The SPI showed the highest and lowest correlation with MCZI (0.71) and EDI (0.34), respectively. The results of testing dataset (2011–2020) indicated that the SVR-RSM produced superior abilities for both accuracy and tendency compared to other models, while the SVR-PSO model is better than the ANN and SVR. The worst results of drought prediction were obtained for EDI. However, all models provided the acceptable EDI prediction in the high-temperature station of Ahvaz in the south of the country. Application of SVR-RSM as a novel hybrid model can be suggested for predicting the DIs on a short time scale in arid and semi-arid areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), there is a good amount of precipitation, surface water, and groundwater, but the main issue is mismanagement of those sources. Rainfall is one of the major sources of water resources in KRI. In order to manage the available water resources and prevent natural disasters such as floods and droughts, there is a need for reliable models for forecasting rainfall. The current study focuses on developing a hybrid model, namely seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average combined with an artificial neural network (SARIMA-ANN) for forecasting monthly rainfall at Sulaymaniyah City for the duration of 1938–2012. For comparison purposes, a conventional machine learning model, namely artificial neural networks (ANN) has been applied on the same data. Two different statistical measurements, namely, root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), have been used to check the accuracy of the proposed models. According to the findings, SARIMA-ANN outperformed ANN with RMSE ¼ 11.5, RMSE ¼ 51.002, R2 ¼ 0.98, R2 ¼ 0.43, respectively.

   abstract = {Climate warming will accelerate the global hydrological cycle and intensify the risk of extreme precipitation and floods. Accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting is fundamental to flood risk mitigation. In this study, we develop a streamflow prediction model by coupling physics-based models, namely, the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) and catchment-based macroscale floodplain (CaMa-Flood) models, with deep learning methods, i.e., the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), which complement physics-based models. Two hybrid models, namely, the VIC-CaMa-Flood-RNN (VCR) and VIC-CaMa-Flood-LSTM (VCL) models, are established that provide the advantages of both physics-based and data-driven models. The results show that (1) the VCL model achieves the best performance among the proposed models in streamflow and flood prediction. It outperforms the VCR model, with a potential increase of up to 4.94% in Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and 1.18% in correlation coefficient (R), as well as an improvement of 15.8% in the maximum flood volumes (MAX). (2) in this study, we investigate the actual contribution of various input features (precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed) to the hybrid model-simulated streamflow. The results show that the minimum temperature is the most significant feature, followed by precipitation, maximum temperature, and wind speed. When the maximum and minimum temperatures are considered as temperature features, temperature and precipitation are the most important features affecting the hybrid model-simulated streamflow, with the actual contribution exceeding 80%. (3) during the 2040 and 2090 s, considering the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the monthly average streamflow will increase with increasing temperature, and flood seasons will be prolonged. This study is a novel attempt to couple physics-based and data-driven models, which can further improve the streamflow and flood prediction accuracy and provide reliable support for future flood risk assessments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

In light of evaporation's effect on drought, this research intends to evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid machine learning (ML) models, such as the Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) technique paired with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Robust Empirical Mode Decomposition (REMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) signal decomposition techniques, for monthly evaporation prediction models in the Southeast Anatolia Project Area. In the design of the models, 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing. Furthermore, tenfold cross-validation was applied to solve the overfitting problem, which negatively affected the forecast performance. In the model setup, various combinations of precipitation, average air temperature, minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, wind speed, actual air pressure, relative humidity, and solar time variables are presented to artificial intelligence models as input. The study revealed that the GBM methodology in combination with the signal decomposition methods REMD, EMD, EEMD, and VMD generally allowed for more accurate evaporation estimations than the GBM model alone.

   abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in transferring water and converting energy in the land–atmosphere system. Accurately estimating ET is crucial for understanding global climate change, ecological environmental problems, the water cycle, and hydrological processes. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been considered as a promising method for estimating ET in recent years. However, due to the limitations associated with the spatial–temporal resolution of the flux tower data commonly used as the target set in ML algorithms, the ability of ML to discover the inherent laws within the data is reduced. In this study, a hybrid framework was established to simulate ET in data-deficient areas. ET simulation results of a coupled model comprising the Budyko function and complementary principle (BC2021) were used as the target set of the random forest model, instead of using the flux station observation data. By combining meteorological and hydrological data, the monthly ET of the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River Basin (IMSYRB) was simulated from 1982 to 2020, and good results were obtained (R2 = 0.94, MAE = 3.82 mm/mon, RMSE = 5.07 mm/mon). Furthermore, the temporal and spatial variations in ET and the influencing factors were analysed. In the past 40 years, annual ET in the IMSYRB ranged between 241.38 mm and 326.37 mm, showing a fluctuating growth trend (slope = 0.80 mm/yr), and the summer ET accounted for the highest proportion in the year. Spatially, ET in the IMSYRB showed a regular distribution of high ET in the eastern region and low ET in the western area. The high ET value areas gradually expanded from east to west over time, and the area increased continuously, with the largest increase observed in the 1980s. Temperature, precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were found to be the most important factors affecting ET in the region and play a positive role in promoting ET changes. These results provide an excellent example of long-term and large-scale accurate ET simulations in an area with sparse flux stations. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Accurate prediction of evapotranspiration values is important in planning agricultural irrigation, crop growth research, and hydrological modeling. This study is aimed at estimating monthly evapotranspiration (ET) values in Hakkâri province by combining support vector regression, bagged tree, and boosted tree methods with wavelet transform. For this purpose, precipitation, runoff, surface net solar radiation, air temperatures, and previous ET values were divided into sub-signals with various mother wavelets such as Daubechies 4, Meyer, and Symlet 2 and presented as input to machine learning (ML) algorithms. The study’s main contribution to the literature is to reveal which wavelet-based machine learning model, mother wavelet type, and combination of meteorological data show the most realistic results in ET estimation. While establishing the models, the data were divided into 80% training and 20% testing. The models’ performances were based on the widely used root mean square error, mean absolute error, determination coefficient, and Taylor diagrams. As a result of the study, it was revealed that the hybrid wavelet ML, which is established with input combinations separated into subcomponents by wavelet transform, generally produces more successful predictions than the stand-alone ML model. In addition, it was revealed that the optimum ET forecasting model was obtained with the wavelet bagged tree algorithm with Symlet 2 mother wavelet. Even though the best model established is based on the precipitation and temperature inputs, it was revealed that past ET, solar radiation, and runoff values are also effective inputs in ET prediction. The results can also be used in other regions of the world with semi-arid climates, such as Hakkâri. The study’s outputs provide essential resources to decision-makers and planners to manage water resources and plan agricultural irrigation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The effectiveness of the hybrid models is evaluated using streamflow runoff data obtained from the Grand, Winnipeg, and Moosonee Rivers in Ontario, Canada. Four widely used performance indices, namely, correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute relative error, and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, are employed to assess the models’ performance. The results demonstrate that the hybrid EMD-ML models exhibit significantly superior performance compared with the standalone ML methods. During the validation phase, the EMD-Ensemble, EMD-SVM, EMD-CNN, and EMD-ANN-BP models exhibit notable reductions in the RMSEs of monthly streamflow estimates for the Grand River, amounting to 11%, 22%, 8%, and 33%, respectively, compared with their non-EMD counterparts. Additionally, these hybrid models exhibit improved RMSEs for yearly simulations in the Winnipeg River, with reductions of 54%, 0.08%, 6%, and 4.5% respectively. To further enhance the accuracy of monthly and yearly streamflow estimates, an SVM-recursive feature elimination technique is employed to select a more appropriate EMD dataset in all study cases. This research underscores the potential of integrating EMD with ML models to enhance long-term runoff simulations. The outcomes highlight the superior performance of the hybrid EMD-ML models, demonstrating their ability in generating lower biases than the standalone ML methods. These findings hold significant implications for the field of computational fluid mechanics and can contribute to the understanding of hydrological processes. © 2023 The Author(s).

   abstract = {An accurate estimation of the sea surface temperature (SST) is of great importance. Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model to predict SST in the Cąnakkale Strait. The observed monthly air temperature, evaporation and precipitation data from the Cąnakkale meteorological observation station were used as input data. The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system was applied. The grid partition method (ANFIS-GP) and the subtractive clustering partitioning method (ANFIS-SC) were used with Gaussian membership functions to generate the fuzzy inference system. Six performance evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the developed SST prediction models, including mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and correlation of determination (R2). The dataset was randomly divided into training and testing datasets for the machine learning process. Training data accounted for 75% of the dataset, while 25% of the dataset was allocated for testing in ANFIS. The hybrid algorithm was selected as a training algorithm for the ANFIS. Simulation results revealed that the ANFIS-SC4 model provided a higher correlation coefficient of 0.96 between the observed and predicted SST values. The results of this study suggest that the developed ANFIS model can be applied for predicting sea surface temperature around the world. © 2020 Faculty of Oceanography and Geography, University of Gdańsk, Poland 2020.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the monthly long-term precipitation of the city of Ardabil from 1976 to 2020 is simulated by a modern hybrid learning machine. To this end, the Wavelet and Outlier Robust Extreme Learning Machine (ORELM) models are integrated to produce a hybrid model called “Wavelet-Outlier Robust Extreme Learning Machine (WORELM)”. First, the observed data are normalized, and the best normalization coefficients for the study are acquired. About 70% of the observed data are employed to train the artificial intelligence models and the remaining (i.e., 30%) to test them. After that, the optimal mother wavelet and the best decomposition level of the wavelet model are computed. Then, the optimal number of the hidden layer neurons and the best activation function of the ORELM model is chosen by performing a trial and error procedure. In this study, the regularization parameter of the ORELM model is also optimized. Moreover, using the autocorrelation function (ACF), the most influencing lags of the time-series data are detected, and 14 WORELM models are developed. By analyzing the WORELM models, the best model and the effective lags of the time-series data are introduced. The outcomes of the hybrid WORELM model are finally compared with other machine learning (ML) algorithms to prove the superiority of the WORELM model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

This paper introduces a semi-empirical predictive model to predict monthly precipitation and compares its predictive skill with those of machine learning (ML) methods. The stochastic method presented herein estimates monthly precipitation with one-step-ahead prediction properties. The ML predictive skill of the algorithms is evaluated by predicting monthly precipitation relying on the statistical association between precipitation and environmental and topographic factors. The semi-empirical predictive model features non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for investigating the influence of multiple predictor variables on precipitation. The semi-empirical predictive model’s parameters are optimized with the hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM), or GALMA, yielding a validated model with high predictive skill. The methodologies are illustrated with data from Hubei Province, China, which comprise 27 meteorological station datasets from 1988–2017.

To this end, monthly data obtained from a 31-year period record including rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, and maximum and minimum relative humidity rates were considered as the required input to predict SPI. In addition, different inputs were combined and constructed to determine the most effective parameter. Finally, the obtained results were validated using visual and quantitative criteria. According to the results, the best input combination comprised both meteorological variable and SPI along with lag time. Although hybrid models enhanced the results of standalone models, the accuracy of the best performing models could vary on different SPI time scales. Overall, BA, DA and RC models were much more effective than AR models. Moreover, RMSE value increased from SPI (3) to SPI (48), indicating that performance modeling would become much more challenging and complex on higher time scales. Finally, the performance of the newly developed models was compared with that of conventional and most commonly used Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models, regarded as the benchmark. The results revealed that all the newly developed models were characterized by higher prediction power than ANFIS and ANN. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.},

   abstract = {Downscaling techniques are effective to bridge the scale gap between global circulation models and regional studies. Statistical downscaling methods are prevalent due to their advantages in high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, an implicit assumption of most statistical techniques is that time series should be relatively stationary after certain function transformations. Otherwise, statistics of nonstationary time series may be meaningless for describing future behavior. In this study, a hybrid statistical downscaling framework was developed through integrating bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and a machine learning method to extract multi-timescale features from nonstationary data to enhance downscaling performance. The proposed framework can reduce the effects of non-stationarity in data-driven models by using the BEMD method, which can decompose time series into independent and stationary components at multiple time-frequency resolutions. It was applied to downscale monthly precipitation and temperature of Canadian Earth System Model in multiple stations with different climate types in the Central Valley of California, USA, to verify its accuracy and generalization ability. The performance of downscaling maximum and minimum temperatures (R2 > 0.9) was more accurate than that of precipitation. The potential reason is that precipitation is more sensitive to transient weather phenomena, which can only be extracted from data with higher temporal resolution. The proposed model was further compared with models based on discrete wavelet transform and models without time series decomposition. The results showed that a decomposition strategy of the proposed framework can improve the downscaling accuracy, potentially providing a viable option to deal with the nonstationary of data in statistical downscaling models. © 2022.

   abstract = {Accurate forecasting of runoff as an important hydrological variable is a key task for water resources planning and management. Given the importance of this variable, in the current study, a multivariate linear stochastic model (MLSM) is combined with a multilayer nonlinear machine learning model (MNMLM) to generate a hybrid model for the spatial and temporal simulation of runoff in the Quebec basin, Canada. Monthly hydrological data from 2001 to 2013, including precipitation and runoff data from nine stations and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extraction of MODIS data, are applied as input to the proposed hybrid model. At the first step of the hybrid modeling, data normality and stationary were examined by performing various tests. In the second step, MLSM was developed by defining four different scenarios and as a result 15 sub-scenarios. The first and second scenarios were developed based on one exogenous variable (precipitation or NDVI). In contrast, the second and third scenarios were developed based on two additional variables. In the first and third scenarios, the data are modeled without preprocessing. In the second and fourth scenarios, a preprocessing step is performed on the data. Then, in the third step, various combinations based on different time delays from runoff data were applied for developing nonlinear model. The comparisons are made between observed and simulated time series at various stations and based on the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The efficiency of the proposed hybrid model is compared with a novel machine learning model that was introduced in 2021 by Sultani et al., and it was also compared with the results obtained from the linear and nonlinear models. In most stations, delays (t-1) and (t-24) are identified as the most effective delays in hybrid and nonlinear modeling of runoff. Also, in most stations, the use of climatic parameters and physiographic factors as exogenous variables along with runoff data improves the results compared to the use of one variable. Results showed that at all stations, proposed hybrid model generally leads to more accurate estimates of runoff compared with various linear and nonlinear models. More accurate estimates of peak runoff values at all stations were another excellence of proposed hybrid model than other models. © 2023, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {The authors regret that some information about the previous studies in the section of literature review has mistakenly been mentioned or missed; and thus, the authors would like to correct. Please note that none of these changes impact on the conclusions made by the paper [1] but are necessary to correct for accuracy. The Supporting Information has also been updated to reflect these corrections. In the Section “1.2. Literature review” of the paper [1], the authors presented several studies that have proposed various methods to estimate the global solar radiation on horizontal surface in places without any observations and classified these methods into deterministic and data-driven models. To make it clear, the authors modify the classification of the methods into three types as follows: In the Section “1.2. Literature review” of the paper [1] Previous studies proposed various methods to estimate the global solar radiation on the horizontal surface in places without no observations. The proposed methods can be classified into three types: (i) deterministic models; (ii) data-driven models; and (iii) both of them (i.e. deterministic and data-driven models) [2,8–24] (refer to Tables 1–3). - Deterministic models (refer to Table 1): Deterministic models are based on physical process and mathematical formulas, explaining the mechanisms of the solar radiation. Some studies improved deterministic models with some modifications of the relevant parameters and clarified the applicability of the developed models in different places [2,8–13]. Zhao et al. [10] improved an Angström–Prescott (A–P) equation by introducing the air pollution index (API) in estimating the daily solar radiation. For nine stations in China, the study defined sunshine hours, geographical position, altitude and API as independent variables that were used to determine the regression parameters of three forms of models (i.e. linear, exponential and logarithmic models). The improvement in the prediction performance of the developed model with API was proven to be more significant in highly-polluted locations. Fan et al. [13] proposed the four types of the sunshine-based estimation models by considering the combinations of input parameters (e.g., sunshine duration, air temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, and relative humidity). The proposed models combined with sunshine duration were expected to accurately estimate the daily global solar radiation in South China.- Data-driven models (refer to Table 2): Other studies developed data-driven models using various algorithms, as a black-box method, so as to estimate the solar radiation in different regions [14–21]. Chen et al. [14] used the temperature-based support vector machine (SVM) methods to estimate the monthly solar radiation in Chongqing, China. The study attempted to evaluate the various kernel functions and the combinations of input variables. The SVM model with polynomial kernel function using maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) as input variables was proven to be the most promising method. Wang et al. [19] used three kinds of artificial neural network (ANN) methods (i.e. multi-layer perceptron (MLP), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and radial basis neural network (RBNN)), in which the routinely-measured meteorological datasets were considered to predict the daily global solar radiation at 12 stations in different climate zones of China. The MLP and RBNN models were finally considered with higher applicability in different climate zones of China.- Deterministic and Data-driven models (refer to Table 3): The other studies compared the prediction performance between deterministic models and data-driven models [22–24]. Zou et al. [23] proposed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) as a data-driven model and compared with expanded-improved bristow-campbell model (E-IBCM) and improved yang hybrid model (IYHM) as deterministic models to predict daily global solar irradiance in China. The ANFIS model performed better than the E-IBCM and IYHM in predicting global solar radiation in Hunan province with subtropical monsoon climate. Qin et al. [24] estimated the daily solar radiation at different climate and terrain in China by using the deterministic models (e.g. parameterization radiation model, hourly solar radiation model) and the data-driven model (i.e. ANN method). The prediction accuracy of the deterministic models was determined to be superior to that of the data-driven model.In particular, some information on the following three papers has been modified or supplemented: - First, Zang et al. [2] developed a new empirical model (deterministic model) based on day of the year and compared with other two existing models (based on day of the year), which could estimate the daily global solar radiation on horizontal surface at 35 stations across China using 10 years data-driven from typical meteorological years (TMYs) for the 35 cities which were generated using the Finkelstein–Schafer statistical method. The model based on day of the year is a deterministic one that is independent model where it uses only the number of days of the year to predict solar radiation and used by several researchers [3–7]. Thus, the summarized data about the work of Zang et al. [2], which was listed in Table 2 of the study by Koo et al. [1], was moved from Table 2 to Table 1 as listed in this corrigendum.- Second, Liu et al. [8] used the k-means clustering and support vector machine-genetic algorithm (SVM-GA) methods for solar radiation zoning, but not for estimating the global solar radiation. They estimated the global solar radiation by four existing sunshine-based models and combined the site-specific models with the geographical parameters in general model which previously developed in literature. That is, the developed models were deterministic models (but not data-driven models). Thus, the summarized data about the work of Liu et al. [8], which was listed in Table 3 of the study by Koo et al. [1], was corrected and moved from Table 3 to Table 1 as listed in this corrigendum.- Third, Zou et al. [23] proposed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) (data-driven models) to predict daily global solar irradiance in China and compared the developed models with the expanded-improved bristow-campbell model (E-IBCM) and the improved yang hybrid model (IYHM) (deterministic models). However, the information in Table 3 of the study by Koo et al. [1] has only described the details of the deterministic model, where the details of the data-driven model has been missed. Thus, the summarized data about the work of Zou et al. [23], which was listed in Table 3 of the study by Koo et al. [1], was corrected and updated in Table 2 as listed in this corrigendum.Remarks for researchers and readers. All comments and corrections that listed in this corrigendum do not influence the obtained results of Koo et al. [1] and the main purpose of this work is to illustrate the missed and mistakenly mentioned information of some literature, which makes the scientific data and literature of the mentioned work clear and reliable. Additionally, from the previous discussion, it would be helpful for the potential readers and researchers to follow the literature and be up to date with the publication in the subject of interest.

   abstract = {Due to its heterogeneous and complex nature, groundwater modeling needs great effort to quantify the aquifer, a crucial tool for policymakers and hydrogeologists to understand the variations in groundwater levels (GWL). This study proposed a set of supervised machine learning (ML) models to delineate the GWL changes in the Zarand-Saveh complex aquifer in Iran using 15-year (2005–2020) monthly dataset. The wavelet transform (WT) procedure was also used to improve the GWL prediction ability of ML models for 3-month horizons using input datasets of precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, and GWL. The four well-accepted standalone ML methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), group method of data handling (GMDH), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM), were implemented and compared with the hybrid wavelet conjunction models. The methods were compared based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Comparison outcomes showed that the hybrid wavelet–ML considerably improved the standalone model results. The wavelet transform-least square support vector machine (WT-LSSVM) model was superior to other standalone and hybrid wavelet–ML methods to predict GWL. The best GWL predictions were acquired from the WT-LSSVM model with input scenario 5 involving all influential variables, and this model produced RMSE, MAE, R, and NSE as 0.05, 0.04, 0.99, and 0.99 for 1 month ahead of GWL prediction, while the corresponding values were obtained as 0.18, 0.14, 0.95, and 0.90 for 3 months ahead of GWL prediction, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Climate change occasionally leads to unprecedented groundwater level decline. This study investigates the impacts of climate change on groundwater level and pumping electricity consumption concurrently over an agricultural region in Central Taiwan. A hybrid deep learning model i.e., CNN-LSTM was employed to predict future groundwater level and pumping electricity using monthly precipitation and average temperature as exogenous inputs from 2007 to 2021. We adopted future projections for these climate inputs from the latest CMIP6 climate models spanning 15 years (2022–36) for shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585). Results revealed that the groundwater level fluctuations in the region are indirectly influenced by climate-induced pumping, as evidenced by exacerbated energy consumption for groundwater extraction during periods of high temperatures and reduced precipitation. Future projections imply that pumping electricity is expected to rise by 2.5–5 % while groundwater level may decline by more than 1 m due to a reduction in average precipitation of about 50–150 mm and a rise in temperature of about 0.7–1.3 °C, respectively over the next 15 years (2022–36). Most notable impacts are witnessed for irrigation-intensive regions such as mid and distal fans. This study necessitates the need to collect and involve pumping along with climate information for a more pragmatic assessment of future groundwater level that may indirectly threaten the food and water security in the region through proficient management of groundwater resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

The conventional methods are limited by their inability to capture the high precipitation variability in time and space. The proposed multiscale method was tested and validated over the Krishna River basin in India. The results from the proposed methods were compared with contemporary models based on Multiple Linear Regression and Neural Networks. Overall, the forecasting accuracy was higher using the wavelet-based hybrid models than the single-scale models. The wavelet-based methods yielded results with 13–34% reduced error when compared with the best single-scale models. The proposed multi-scale model was then applied to the different climatic regions of the country, and it was shown that the model could forecast rainfall with reasonable accuracy for different climate zones of the country. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Accurate precipitation forecasts are much attractive due to their complexity. This study aimed to use the hybrid Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model and machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to improve precipitation forecasts. Time variation analysis and time series decomposition were the two concepts applied to construct the hybrid models. The performance of the two concepts was evaluated with monthly precipitation time series of two stations in northern Iran. Time variation analysis of time series was conducted with the clustering analysis, which increased the accuracy of forecasting with 20.99% decrease in the geometric mean error ratio for the two stations. SVM model decreased the forecasted error compared to ANN in the internal process of time variation analysis. Average of Mean Relative Error (MRE) were MRESVM= 0.72, MREANN= 0.89, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the two stations were MAESVM= 18.02 and MAEANN= 23.88. Therefore, SVM outperformed the ANN model. Comparison of the two hybrid models indicated that more accurate results belonged to the concept of time series decomposition (the decrease in root mean square error from time variation to time series decomposition concepts was 13.35%). Extracting the pattern of data with SARIMA-based hybrid model with time series decomposition improved the precipitation forecasting. Configurations related to nonlinear components of time series with time steps of residual had good performance (the average of agreement index was 0.9). The results suggest that the hybrid model can be a valuable and effective tool for decision processes, and time series decomposition to linear and nonlinear components has a better performance. © 2020, Tarbiat Modares University.

In this study, a novel binary optimized machine learning model, the random vector functional link (RVFL) with the integration of Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm (MFO) and Water Cycle Optimization Algorithm (WCA) is examined to estimate the monthly and daily temperature time series of Rajshahi Climatic station in Bangladesh. Various combinations of temperature and precipitation were used to predict the temperature time series. The prediction ability of the novel binary optimized machine learning model (RVFL-WCAMFO) is compared with the single optimized machine learning models (RVFL-WCA and RVFL-MFO) and the standalone machine learning model (RVFL). Root mean square errors (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and the determination coefficient (R2) statistical indexes were utilized to access the prediction ability of the selected models. The proposed binary optimized machine learning model (RVFL-WCAMFO) outperformed the other single optimized and standalone machine learning models in prediction of air temperature time series on both scales, i.e., daily and monthly scale. Cross-validation technique was applied to determine the best testing dataset and it was found that the M3 dataset provided more accurate results for the monthly scale, whereas the M1 dataset outperformed the other two datasets on the daily scale. On the monthly scale, periodicity input was also added to see the effect on prediction accuracy. It was found that periodicity input improved the prediction accuracy of the models. It was also found that precipitation-based inputs did not provided very accurate results in comparison to temperature-based inputs. The outcomes of the study recommend the use of RVFL-WCAMFO in air temperature modeling. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {In seasonal weather forecasting, the exact location within a study area determines the relationship between local predicted variables and global predictors. Both dynamic models and machine learning approaches that define models for single grid points can determine these relationships with high spatial granularity, but at high computational cost. To avoid the latter, clustering of predicted variables is often used in machine learning approaches, which however sacrifices geographical resolution. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach that is a hybrid between gridpoint and cluster-based approaches (finres_S2S). This approach preserves geographical resolution, but at low computational cost, and is tested for monthly 2-m temperature (2T) and precipitation (TP) in Tanzania and for a lead time of up to 6 months. The finres_S2S approach has a number of advantages over both the cluster and point approaches, including that of obtaining good results compared to a dynamic model. We find that the dominant predictors for the application area are associated with El Niño–Southern Oscillation, the Madden–Julian oscillation, and the Indian Ocean dipole. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Seasonal forecasting of atmospheric parameters is important in various fields including agriculture. Machine learning makes it possible to forecast at lower computational costs than dynamic models. This advantage is even more important in certain regions of the world. The hybrid model developed here (finres_S2S) allows seasonal forecasting with a spatial resolution equal to that of ERA5 data and a low cost in calculation time. The model is tested over Tanzania, and the seasonal forecast scores outperform those of ECMWF. The development of the use of machine learning in seasonal forecasting seems to provide a complementary response to dynamic models, and research efforts in this direction should be pursued. © 2024 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Evaporation is a crucial factor in hydrological studies; its precise measurement has always been challenging due to the costly recording tolls. Therefore, machine learning models that can give reliable predictive results with the least information available have been recommended for evaporation prediction. This study was conducted in the central of Iran using the data related to the Doroudzan dam. Several hydrological and meteorological variables, including inflow and outflow of the reservoir, lake area behind the dam, temperature, overflow from the reservoir, precipitation, and evaporation at the previous month, were considered input data to predict the evaporation at the current month. Monthly data from October 1999 to September 2020 were used during the modeling. First, the single adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) models were evaluated for predicting the amount of evaporation using different scenarios defined based on the different combinations of input variables. The results showed that LS-SVR with RMSE = 2.77, MAPE = 2.48, and NSE = 0.93 provided a better prediction than ANFIS. Second, the Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of ANFIS to check for the possibility of performance improvement. The hybrid ANFIS-HHO model predicted the evaporation with RMSE = 2.35, MAPE = 1.55, and NSE = 0.95, respectively. The Taylor’s diagram also demonstrated the superior performance of the hybrid ANFIS-HHO model than the LS-SVR and ANFIS models. The best scenario for all three models included all input variables but the area behind the dam into the models. The methodology proposed in this study is useful for predicting the evaporation from dam reservoirs under the influence of various dam variables. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

   abstract = {Due to the inherent non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of original streamflow and the complicated relationship between multi-scale predictors and streamflow, accurate and reliable monthly streamflow forecasting is quite difficult. In this paper, a multi-scale-variables-driven stream-flow forecasting (MVDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy and provide more information for decision-making. This framework was realized by integrating random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with multi-scale variables (hydrometeorological and climate predictors) as inputs and is referred to as RF-GPR-MV. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the RF-GPR-MV model, it was implemented for multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasts with horizons of 1 to 12 months for two key hydrological stations in the Jinsha River basin, Southwest China. Other MVDSF models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and GPR with/without multi-scale variables or the PCC and a backpropagation neural network (BP) or general regression neural network (GRNN), with only previous streamflow and precipitation, namely, PCC-GPR-MV, PCC-GPR-QP, PCC-BP-QP, and PCC-GRNN-QP, respectively, were selected as benchmarks. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model was superior to the other benchmark models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for almost all forecasting scenarios, especially for forecasting with longer lead times. Additionally, the results also confirmed that the addition of large-scale climate and circulation factors was beneficial for promoting the streamflow forecasting ability, with an average contribution rate of about 15%. The RF in the MVDSF framework improved the forecasting performance, with an average contribution rate of about 25%. This improvement was more pronounced when the lead time exceeded 3 months. Moreover, the proposed model could also provide prediction intervals (PIs) to characterize forecast uncertainty, as supple-mentary information to further help decision makers in relevant departments to avoid risks in water resources management. © 2022 by the authors.

These methods can analyze large volumes of data and detect the existing trends and patterns. Therefore, in the present study, machine learning methods, including random forests (RF), Kstar algorithm and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were used to predict the precipitation of Sindh River basin in India during period of 1901 to 2020. In the next step, three distinct input scenarios include (i) using monthly precipitation data and considering the memory of time series up to 5 months delay, (ii) adding periodic term to the first scenario inputs and (iii) decomposing the data using the Daubechies 4 wavelet function and creating hybrid wavelet-learning machine (W-ML) models, were prepared and introduced to the models. The performance of each method was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Kling–Gupta efficiency score (KGE) and Willmott index (WI). The results showed that single models with the first scenario inputs (without taking into account the periodicity of the data) did not have good accuracy, but by adding the periodicity, the performance of these models was significantly improved, and the average value of KGE index for all studied stations increased from 0.466 to 0.672. It was also found that the GPR model for all stations could not have good performance and RF and Kstar models are the most appropriate methods for predicting precipitation in the Sindh River basin, respectively. With the application of the third scenario and the development of W-ML hybrid models, the accuracy of precipitation forecasting was significantly improved, especially the maximum precipitation values were estimated with higher accuracy than standalone models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.},

The structure of the proposed approach is composed of two parts: input selection and average monthly precipitation simulation. Data from the Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) was chosen, and the input selection based on a Machine Learning-based (ML) method, i.e. the decision tree model (M5), was applied to select the most important predictors amongst many potential large-scale climate variables of the CMIP5 model. Next, the Random Forest (RF) model was trained, using the observed precipitation time series using the most important predictor variables, to downscale the precipitation time series of the CMIP5 model for the historical period (1992–2005) over the study area. Using the hybrid M5-RF model led to a reliable performance in the prediction of precipitation time series as the resulting Correlation Coefficient (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values were 0.78 and 0.1 for calibration and 0.75 and 0.13 for validation, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

   abstract = {Accurate groundwater level (GWL) estimation is significant to attain sustainable developmental goals and management of integrated water resources. But, its all-time accessibility is of serious concern. Hence, it is crucial to understand the groundwater potential for utilisation of water resources. There has been a significant decline in urban groundwater resources in past few decades because of over-exploitation, climatic change, urbanisation, and population growth. For understanding the effect of climate change variables on the fluctuation of GWL, a machine learning-based model is developed integrating sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and support vector machine (SVM). The developed model is utilised for predicting GWLs in Cuttack, a heavily inhabited city with decreasing groundwater resources. Precipitation, minimum relative humidity, and GWL of current, one-month lag, and two-month are taken as input parameters to predict the GWL on monthly basis. Three statistical indices, namely root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), are applied for performance evaluation of SVM-SSA method. The results reveal that SVM-SSA with RMSE of 0.5876 (m), R2 of 0.9698, and NS of 0.968 significantly outperforms SVM with RMSE of 9.9891 (m), R2 of 0.9345, and NS of 0.9326. The study’s findings indicate that SVM-SSA model is an acceptable data-driven method for predicting skewed and nonstationary monthly GWL time series, demonstrating a suitable tool for monthly GWL prediction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

   abstract = {In many parts of semiarid and arid regions, qanats are the leading supplier of water demand for agricultural and drinking usage. Qanat is an ancient collecting water system, and qanat water flow (QWF) varies in different seasons and decreases gradually by pumping groundwater wells. The present research utilized a set of supervised machine learning (ML) models to predict the QWF in the Chaghlondi Aquifer in Iran using monthly intervals of 14 years (2007–2021). The wavelet transform (WT) technique was also applied to enhance the QWF prediction quality of ML models for three lead months utilizing QWF, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature and GWL signal datasets as input. The five widely used ML models, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, group method of data handling (GMDH), gene expression programming and least square support vector machine, were applied and then compared with their hybrid wavelet models. To assess the performance of the models, the following four evaluation criteria were employed: correlation coefficient (R), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root means squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The outcomes showed that the hybrid-wavelet ML considerably improved the standalone model performance. The best QWF predictions for a one-month ahead QWF prediction were acquired from the WT-GMDH model results from input scenario 3 with RMSE, MAE, R and NSE equal to 14.46, 10.78, 0.93 and 0.85, respectively. In addition, the result of this study indicates that ML's performance was improved by using wavelet transform for two and three months ahead of QWF predictions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.},

   abstract = {In recent years, as a result of climate change as well as rainfall reduction in arid and semi-arid regions, modelling qualitative and quantitative parameters belonging to aquifers has become crucially important. In Iran, as aquifers are treated as the most commonly used drinking water resources, modelling their qualitative and quantitative parameters is enormously important. In this paper, for the first time, values of salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), groundwater level (GWL) and electrical conductivity (EC) of the Arak Plain, located in Markazi Province, Iran, are simulated by means of four modern artificial intelligence models including extreme learning machine (ELM), wavelet extreme learning machine (WELM), online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) and wavelet online sequential extreme learning machine (WOSELM) as well as the MODFLOW software for a 15-year period monthly. To develop the hybrid artificial intelligence models, the wavelet is employed. First, the effective lags in estimating the qualitative and quantitative parameters of the groundwater are identified using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) analysis. After that, four different models are developed by the selected input combinations and also the ACF and the PACF in the form of different lags for each of ELM, WAELM, OSELM and WOSELM methods. Then, the superior models in simulating the groundwater qualitative and qualitative parameters are detected by conducting a sensitivity analysis. To forecast the electrical conductivity (EC) by the best WOSELM model, the values of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSC), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the scatter index (SI) are obtained to be 0.991, 18.005 and 4.28E-03, respectively. In addition, the most effective lags in estimating these parameters are introduced. Subsequently, the results found by the MODFLOW model are compared with those of the artificial intelligence models and it is concluded that the latter are more accurate. For instance, the scatter index and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values calculated by WOSELM for TDS, respectively, are 5.34E-03 and 0.991. Finally, an uncertainty analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of different numerical models. For example, MODFLOW has an underestimated performance in simulating the salinity parameter. © 2020 CIWEM},

   abstract = {Monitoring water resources requires accurate predictions of rainfall data. Our study introduces a novel deep learning model named the deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN)—temporal convolutional network (TCN) to remove redundant features and extract temporal features from rainfall data. The TCN model extracts temporal features, and the DRSN enhances the quality of the extracted features. Then, the DRSN–TCN is coupled with a random forest (RF) model to model rainfall data. Since the RF model may be unable to classify and predict complex patterns and data, our study develops the RF model to model outputs with high accuracy. Since the DRSN–TCN model uses advanced operators to extract temporal features and remove irrelevant features, it can improve the performance of the RF model for predicting rainfall. We use a new optimizer named the Gaussian mutation (GM)–orca predation algorithm (OPA) to set the DRSN–TCN–RF (DTR) parameters and determine the best input scenario. This paper introduces a new machine learning model for rainfall prediction, improves the accuracy of the original TCN, and develops a new optimization method for input selection. The models used the lagged rainfall data to predict monthly data. GM–OPA improved the accuracy of the orca predation algorithm (OPA) for feature selection. The GM–OPA reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) values of OPA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) by 1.4%–3.4% and 6.14–9.54%, respectively. The GM–OPA can simplify the modeling process because it can determine the most important input parameters. Moreover, the GM–OPA can automatically determine the optimal input scenario. The DTR reduced the testing mean absolute error values of the TCN–RAF, DRSN–TCN, TCN, and RAF models by 5.3%, 21%, 40%, and 46%, respectively. Our study indicates that the proposed model is a reliable model for rainfall prediction. © 2024, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Water scarcity is a pressing issue, intensified by factors such as population growth and industrialization. Hence, it is crucial to monitor, conserve and analyse groundwater resources, which are essential sources of clean and usable water. This study examines changes in groundwater levels (GWLs) in northeastern Turkey's mountainous and snow-covered area. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of integrated machine learning models, specifically, the extreme learning machine (ELM) technique combined with signal decomposition techniques such as ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for monthly GWL prediction models. Seventy percent of the accessible data is allocated for training, while 30% is designated for testing. A correlation matrix involving precipitation, temperature, relative humidity and GWL parameters is generated with inputs that possess significant correlations being selected, such as GWLt−1, GWLt−2, RHt, RHt−1 and RHt−2. To evaluate model results, various metrics, including mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean bias error, bias factor, determination coefficient, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, as well as tools such as box plots, Taylor diagrams and radar charts, are utilized to compare outcomes during the interpretation phase. The results of the analyses show that applying data decomposition methods such as EEMD, VMD and EWT significantly improves the performance of the ELM algorithm in predicting GWLs. VMD-ELM is the most accurate for GWL forecasting among the approaches examined. The R2 values of the most successful models established in the two wells are 0.993 and 0.905. The outcomes of this research hold significance for decision-makers and policymakers as it offers informative insights into aquifer surveillance, irrigation strategizing and efficient administration of water resources. © 2024 The Authors.

   abstract = {Due to climate change and increasing demand for water, effective planning of water resources is a current issue. Reliable and accurate streamflow prediction is of great importance in the planning of water resources. This study aimed to predict monthly streamflows in Amasya by combining a discrete wavelet transform and a feedforward backpropagation neural network (FFBPNN) model. Various meteorological variables were separated into sub signals with mother wavelets commonly used in hydrometeorological studies, such as Haar, Daubechies 2, Daubechies 4, Discrete Meyer, Coiflet 3, Coiflet 5, Symlet 3, and Symlet 5, and entered into the FFBBNN model to create a hybrid wavelet-based FFBBNN model. Inputs with a significant relationship with the output were entered into the model. Precipitation, temperature, and previous streamflow values covering 1960–2011 were used to create the model. During the modeling phase, 70% of the data were divided into training, 15% into validation, and 15% into testing. The performance of the model was compared using mean square error, correlation coefficient, and rank analysis. Coiflet 5 mother wavelet showed the best results. Moreover, it was proven that monthly streamflow can be successfully predicted using previous precipitation, temperature, and streamflow values and the Coiflet 5 mother wavelet with the FFBBNN hybrid model (MSE: 7.143, R: 0.921). In addition, all built wavelet FFBPNN models except the Symlet 3 mother wavelet performed better than the single FFBPNN model. The results of the study will assist planners, and decision makers in terms of providing sustainable and effective water resources and drought management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

   abstract = {A continuous and complete spring discharge record is critical in understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of karst aquifers and the variability of freshwater resources. However, due to equipment errors, failure of observation and other reasons, missing data is a common problem for spring discharge monitoring and further hydrological investigations and data analysis. In this study, a novel approach that integrates deep learning algorithms and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is proposed to reconstruct the missing spring discharge data with a given local precipitation record. Using EEMD, the local precipitation data is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from high to low frequencies and a residual function, which are served as the input of convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN-LSTM models to reconstruct the missing discharge data. Evaluation metrics, including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), are calculated to evaluate the reconstruction performance. The monthly spring discharge and precipitation data from March 1978 to October 2021 collected at Barton Springs in Texas are used for the validation and evaluation of newly proposed deep learning models. The results indicate that deep learning models coupled with EEMD overperform the models without EEMD and significantly improve the reconstruction results. The LSTM-EEMD model obtains the best reconstruction results among three deep learning algorithms. For models with monthly data, the missing rate affects the reconstruction performance because of the number of data samples: the best reconstruction results are achieved when the missing rate was low. If the missing rate was 50%, the reconstruction results become notably poorer. However, when the daily precipitation and discharge data are used, the models can obtain satisfactory reconstruction results with missing rate ranged from 10 to 50%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Meteorological drought, defined as a decrease in the average amount of precipitation, is among the most insidious natural disasters. Not knowing when a drought will occur (its onset) makes it difficult to predict and monitor it. Scientists face significant challenges in accurately predicting and monitoring global droughts, despite using various machine learning techniques and drought indices developed in recent years. Optimization methods and hybrid models are being developed to overcome these challenges and create effective drought policies. In this study, drought analysis was conducted using The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) with monthly precipitation data from 1920 to 2022 in the Tromsø region. Models with different input structures were created using the obtained SPI values. These models were then analyzed with The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) by means of different optimization methods: The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), The Genetic Algorithm (GA), The Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), and The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and PSO optimization of Support Vector Machine (SVM-PSO). Correlation coefficient (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and RMSE-Standard Deviation Ratio (RSR) served as performance evaluation criteria. The results of this study demonstrated that, while successful results were obtained in all commonly used algorithms except for ANFIS-GWO, the best performance values obtained using SPI12 input data were achieved with ANFIS-ABC-M04, exhibiting r: 0.9516, NSE: 0.9054, and RMSE: 0.3108. © 2024 by the authors.},

The current study examined the ability of three renowned machine learning models, namely additive regression (AR), random subspace (RSS), and M5P tree, and their hybridized versions (AR-RSS, AR-M5P, RSS-M5P, and AR-RSS-M5P) in predicting the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in multiple time scales. The SPEIs were calculated using monthly rainfall and temperature data over 39 years (1980–2018). The best subset regression model and sensitivity analysis were used to determine the most appropriate input variables from a series of input combinations involving up to eight SPEI lags. The models were built at Rajshahi station and validated at four other sites (Mymensingh, Rangpur, Bogra, and Khulna) in drought-prone northern Bangladesh. The findings indicated that the proposed models can accurately forecast droughts at the Rajshahi station. The M5P model predicted the SPEIs better than the other models, with the lowest mean absolute error (27.89–62.92%), relative absolute error (0.39–0.67), mean absolute error (0.208–0.49), root mean square error (0.39–0.67) and highest correlation coefficient (0.75–0.98). Moreover, the M5P model could accurately forecast droughts with different time scales at validation locations. The prediction accuracy was better for droughts with longer periods. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The comparative study was conducted focusing on developing and comparing several Machine Learning (ML) models, evaluating different scenarios and time horizon, and forecasting rainfall using two types of methods. Data involved for this research consist of taking the average rainfall from 10 stations around the study area using Thiessen polygon to weight the station area and projected rainfall. The forecasting model uses four different ML algorithms, which are Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR), Boosted Decision Tree Regression (BDTR), Decision Forest Regression (DFR) and Neural Network Regression (NNR). On the other hand, the rainfall was predicted on different time horizon by using different ML's algorithms which is method 1 (M1): Forecasting Rainfall Using Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and method 2 (M2): Forecasting Rainfall Using Projected Error. In M1, the best regression developed for ACF is BDTR since it has the highest coefficient of determination, R2, after tuning the hyperparameter. The results show coefficient between 0.5 and 0.9 with the highest of each scenarios for daily (0.9739693), weekly (0.989461), 10-days (0.9894429) and monthly (0.9998085). In M2, overall model performances show that normalization using LogNormal is preferably giving a good result of each categories except for 10-days with BDTR and DFR are the most acceptable result than NNR and BLR. It is concluded that, two different methods have been applied with different scenarios and different time horizons, and M1 shows a rather high accuracy than M2 using BDTR modeling.},

   abstract = {Accurately simulating river discharge remains a challenge. Hybrid models combining hydrological models with machine learning improve discharge simulation and offer better interpretability than standalone machine learning models. However, the commonly used models are deterministic. This study introduces an innovative extension to stochastic hydrological models, offering a novel combination that has not been previously explored. The proposed approach predicts discharge by integrating the simulated statistical properties of daily discharge probability distributions, derived from a stochastic rainfall-runoff model, into machine learning frameworks. This integration allows the machine learning models to incorporate insights from the uncertainties in discharge, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy of discharge simulations. The hybridization presented combines the physically-based stochastic HyMoLAP (Sto. HyMoLAP) model with machine learning techniques, including Wavelet-based eXtreme Gradient Boosting (WXGBoost) and Wavelet-based Gated Recurrent Unit (WGRU). Evaluated on the Ouémé at Bonou river basin, Benin, the Sto. HyMoLAP-WGRU model shows the best predictive performance, especially for low and high discharges. It achieves an overall Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.896, which is 7.30% higher than the NSE of HyMoLAP, and 29.67% and 259.71% higher than those of the standalone machine learning models. The Combined Accuracy (CA) is 38.11, reflecting reductions of 19.81%, 42.30%, and 62.41% compared to the standalone models. The analyses show that the performance of hybrid models depends on the simulated discharge distribution properties used as input. They suggest that the hybridization approach could be particularly beneficial for runoff simulations in catchments subject to significant random fluctuations where point discharge simulation is challenging.},

Vapor pressure efficiency has been investigated for hybrid streamflow prediction models. Streamflow prediction models have been developed by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and their hybrid models. Hybridization of streamflow prediction models has been made with Wavelet Transform (WT). 10 yearly daily hydrological (discharge (m3/s)), meteorological (precipitation (mm), vapor pressure (hPA)) data, and seasonality coefficient have been used as input data of streamflow prediction models. In the selection of the best streamflow prediction model, 14 different day-delayed input combinations have been established by using 10 yearly data. As a result of the study, the highest flow forecast performance model has been determined as Wavelet Artificial Neural Network (WANN) in the study area. In the WANN model, the vapor pressure parameter was found to reduce the error by about 18.5% and improve the forecast performance.

Reconstruction of precipitation timeseries is gaining increasing attention for monitoring and prediction studies. To address the challenges posed by non-smooth distributions of precipitation data, this research proposes an innovative reweighting method combining simulations from machine-learning and wavelet methods. By amalgamating multiple models, it aims to generate enhanced results, based on the concept that increasing the diversity of simulations and reweighting them improve the accuracy.
New hydrological insights for the region
Particularly in regions like Cork City, which have experienced heavy precipitation events, accurate prediction is vital for informed decision-making. Here, monthly precipitation simulations from 35 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) models of Phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) were utilized. The simulations considered the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, for the hindcast and forecast periods of 1990–2014 and 2076–2100, respectively. Using the proposed technique, the results demonstrate the superior performance of the approach in reconstructing precipitation timeseries from NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 simulations, particularly in dealing with high precipitation intensities, while maintaining accuracy for low intensities. Additionally, the projections indicate that precipitation is expected to decrease from 122.88 during 1990–2014–115.67 (SSP1–2.6) and 118.71 mm/month (SSP5-8.5) in 2076–2100. The findings support the effectiveness of the hybrid method in improving data accuracy and reducing potential uncertainties in simulations.},

The existing forecasting studies have examined the limited effects of weather conditions on solar radiation such as temperature and precipitation utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN), but no comprehensive study has been conducted on concentrations of air pollutants along with weather conditions. This paper proposes a hybrid approach based on deep learning, expanding the feature set by adding new air pollution concentrations, and ranking these features to select and reduce their size to improve efficiency. In order to improve the accuracy of feature selection, a maximum-dependency and minimum-redundancy (mRMR) criterion is applied to the constructed feature space to identify and rank the features. The combination of air pollution data with weather conditions data has enabled the prediction of solar irradiance with a higher accuracy. An evaluation of the proposed approach is conducted in Istanbul over 12 months for 43791 discrete times, with the main purpose of analyzing air data, including particular matter (PM10 and PM25), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NOX), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone (O₃), sulfur dioxide (SO₂) using a CNN, a long short-term memory network (LSTM), and MRMR feature extraction. Compared with the benchmark models with root mean square error (RMSE) results of 76.2, 60.3, 41.3, 32.4, there is a significant improvement with the RMSE result of 5.536. This hybrid model presented here offers high prediction accuracy, a wider feature set, and a novel approach based on air concentrations combined with weather conditions for solar irradiance prediction.},

In this paper, selected piezometers of the Hamedan-Bahar plain located in west of Iran. The main objective of this study is to compare effect of various pre-processing methods on input data for different artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict groundwater levels (GWLs). The observed GWL, evaporation, precipitation, and temperature were used as input variables in the AI algorithms. Firstly, 126 method of data pre-processing was done by python programming which are classified into three classes: 1- statistical methods, 2- wavelet transform methods and 3- decomposition methods; later, various pre-processed data used by four types of widely used AI models with different kernels, which includes: Support Vector Machine (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long-Short Term memory (LSTM), and Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) - Artificial Neural Network (POA-ANN) are classified into three classes: 1- machine learning (SVR and ANN), 2- deep learning (LSTM) and 3- hybrid-ML (POA-ANN) models, to predict groundwater levels (GWLs). Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were used to evaluate and validate the predictive accuracy of algorithms. According to the results, based on summation (train and test phases) of AIC value of 1778 models, average of AIC values for ML, DL, hybrid-ML classes, was decreased to −25.3%, −29.6% and −57.8%, respectively. Therefore, the results showed that all data pre-processing methods do not lead to improvement of prediction accuracy, and they should be selected very carefully by trial and error. In conclusion, wavelet-ANN model with daubechies 13 and 25 neurons (db13_ANN_25) is the best model to predict GWL that has −204.9 value for AIC which has grown by 5.23% (−194.7) compared to the state without any pre-processing method (ANN_Relu_25).},

This study aimed to enhance turbidity predictions in stratified reservoirs and address the challenge of insufficient boundary condition data by developing a hybrid approach combining the CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) process-based model (PBM) with machine learning (ML) techniques. Various ML models were compared against conventional methods for generating turbidity boundary condition data.
New hydrological insights for the region
The hybrid ML-PBM approach significantly improved turbidity predictions, especially during rapid changes associated with rainfall events in the Soyang Reservoir. The long short-term memory model outperformed other ML methods, increasing the W2 model efficiency index by 1.46-fold compared with traditional regression methods. This approach effectively captured complex nonlinear relationships in turbidity dynamics influenced by flow rate and precipitation. The hybrid ML-PBM model accurately predicted high-turbidity event durations crucial for managing downstream ecosystems and water treatment processes. Its potential for enhancing water quality modeling and reservoir management strategies in monsoon-affected regions worldwide was demonstrated, offering a robust solution for predicting water quality dynamics in reservoirs with limited inputs.

It plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance environment and promoting sustainable farming practices. This review examines the evolving trends in remote sensing (RS)-based SOM monitoring by analyzing 739 scholarly publications from the Web of Science database from 2003 to 2023 using a bibliometric approach. The study reveals that research on RS-based SOM monitoring has entered a rapid growth phase since 2018, with China and the United States as the main contributors and an extensive international cooperation network. In model construction, high frequency covariates such as soil pH, precipitation, temperature, and topography significantly improved the prediction accuracy. Data preprocessing methods such as Standard Normal Variables (SNV), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Multiple Scattering Correction (MSC) enhanced data consistency. Traditional statistical models are gradually being replaced by nonlinear machine learning and deep learning methods (CNN, XGBoost, andStacking), which are particularly good at handling complex high-dimensional data. Regional spectral libraries (OzSoil and AfSIS) excel in local accuracy, while global spectral libraries (ISRIC and LUCAS) are more suitable for cross-region modeling, and the migration learning technique effectively improves the model generalization ability in low data regions. Integrated models (CNN-LSTM and GAN) have significant advantages in capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of SOMs, and uncertainty quantification methods (Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo simulation) enhance the reliability of the models in multi-source data and data-scarce scenarios. Future research should focus on further optimization of multi-source data fusion and uncertainty quantification to promote the development and applicability of RS-based SOM monitoring techniques for precision soil management and sustainable agriculture.},

To improve daily runoff prediction accuracy in data-scarce areas, this study focuses on incorporating multiple grid-based data (precipitation, EVI, soil moisture (SM)) to drive the CNN-LSTM hybrid model. The spatial features of precipitation and underlying surface of the basin can be extracted by CNN, while the temporal features of the input data series can be captured by the LSTM. The hybrid model is compared with the single models (CNN, LSTM), and hybrid model performances under different driven data are also investigated.
New hydrological insights for the region
Driven by the in-situ precipitation, grid-based precipitation (GPM) and SM data, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieved the best prediction result with NSE of 0.834, outperforming the single LSTM model (NSE=0.510) and the CNN model (NSE=0.612). It indicates that the hybrid model captures the spatiotemporal change features of precipitation and underlying surface of the basin. When using only GPM and SM data as input, the hybrid model achieved comparable result with NSE of 0.827. It implies that GPM could serve as a good alternative of in-situ precipitation and SM could provide additional value to improve prediction. This study highlights the value of using multiple grid-based data to drive the hybrid model, which provides new insights into runoff prediction in data-scarce regions.},

Drought indices are built on prior expert knowledge but lack calibration based on actual drought events, while data-driven models prioritize goodness of fit over real event identification, undermining their credibility and generalization, and also struggling to generalize from regional to large-scale contexts. To address these challenges, here we introduce a hybrid machine learning framework for time series that combines domain knowledge and observational data in a variational recurrent neural network. The network models the joint distribution of total precipitation, air temperature, and real drought events, providing accurate predictions and uncertainty estimates.

   abstract = {The phenomenon of climate change exerts a substantial influence on the water consumption patterns of agricultural crops, thereby affecting the overall demand for irrigation water and regional water security. The quantitative assessment of future changes in irrigation water requirements has great importance for long-term water resource planning and the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus. This work employed a comprehensive approach (IWRAM) by integrating many models and techniques, including a global climate model (CanESM2), a statistical downscaling model (SDSM), a bias correction technique (QTM), a temperature-based crop phenology method (GDD), and deep learning technology (LSTM), in order to assess the potential impact of climate change on irrigation water demand. Therein, the QTM is utilized for the purpose of bias correction for the CanESM2-SDSMed daily precipitation data. Additionally, the LSTM is implemented to forecast ETo using the CanESM2-SDSMed daily temperature data. The findings from the case study conducted in the Jinghuiqu irrigation area (JIA) indicate that the application of bias correction techniques resulted in notable enhancements in the frequency distribution of predicted precipitation data. Consequently, this led to a more coherent relationship between historical observed data and anticipated future data, aligning them more closely with natural patterns. The deep learning technique exhibited a strong degree of concordance, suggesting its exceptional capacity for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration. By using the IWRAM model, relatively accurate predictions were made for future precipitation, temperature, crop evapotranspiration, and effective precipitation. Consequently, an estimation was made regarding the anticipated need for irrigation water in JIA. These results highlighted that JIA total irrigation water demand (or net irrigation water demand) will increase by 121 mm (net irrigation water: 189 mm) and 119 mm (net irrigation water: 187 mm) in the year 2050 under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Climate change could potentially affect the seasonal distribution of precipitation. Therefore, it is crucial for the authorities in JIA to not only take into account the overall irrigation water requirement but also give priority to the water requirements of each stage of crop growth.},

In this study, a hybrid approach for predicting EC is proposed which first EC is decomposed into approximate and detail parts based on wavelet transfer (WT). Next, the modeling of wavelet components is accomplished based on the adaptive WT (AWT)-long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX)-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) type models. The key concept of AWT–LSTM is adding an optimal set of adaptive layers through which AWT–LSTM can automatically concentrate on various frequency components based on the dynamic evolution of the input sequence revealing the multi-frequency pattern of EC. Then, the components are predicted separately and eventually, the results are combined nonlinearly through random forest (RF) algorithm. Besides the lag calendar setting, the affecting exogenous variables are applied on the electricity consumption in the structure of hybrid models which include humidity, water precipitation, solar radiation, effective temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. To measure the predictive power, the proposed models were tested using a 24 h ahead forecasting horizon using a sample rate of 30 min in two different seasons (winter and summer).

   abstract = {Climate change and increasing water demands underscore the importance of water resource management. Precise precipitation forecasting is critical to effective management. This study introduced a Daily Precipitation Forecasting Hybrid (DPFH) technique for central Thailand, which uses three different input-based models to improve prediction accuracy. •The proposed methods precisely combine the biorthogonal wavelet transformation (BWT) function through BWT-RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Networks) and (BWT-LSTM-RNN)Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks. Comparative analyses reveal that hybrid models perform better than conventional deep LSTM-RNN and Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). Although MLP-ANN showed moderate effectiveness, LSTM-RNN displayed notable enhancements, particularly evidenced by an impressive R2 (0.96) in Model M-2.•The combination of BWT-LSTM-RNN yielded substantial enhancements, constantly surpassing standalone models. Specifically, DPFH-3 exhibited superior performance across multiple observation stations.•The findings emphasize the efficiency of the BWT-LSTM-RNN models in capturing varied precipitation patterns, highlighting their potential to significantly improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts, particularly in the context of water resource management in central Thailand.},

   abstract = {Study region
The Kaidu River Basin originates from the southern slope of the Tienshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.
Study focus
Accurate runoff simulation and prediction significantly affect flood control, drought resilience, and water resource allocation decisions. This study establishes the GR4J-6 model (modèle du Génie Rural à 4 paramètres Journalier-6, including a snowmelt module) and integrates it with the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to construct the hybrid GR4J-6-LSTM model and enhance the simulation accuracy of snowmelt runoff. A case study is conducted in the Kaidu River Basin to demonstrate the applicability of these models in cold and arid regions. The accuracy of the GR4J-6, LSTM, and GR4J-6-LSTM models is evaluated using Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. In addition, the contributions of each feature variable in the models are analyzed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to enhance the reliability of the results.
New hydrological insights for the region
The GR4J-6 model demonstrated good applicability in the Kaidu River Basin, with NSE, KGE, and RMSE values of 0.69, 0.79, and 39.39 m3/s during the validation period, respectively. The hybrid model GR4J-6-LSTM exhibited the highest comprehensive accuracy among all the models, with NSE, KGE, and RMSE values of 0.84, 0.87, and 28.79 m3/s, respectively. In the LSTM model, temperature and precipitation were found to significantly influence the simulated runoff, indicating that higher temperature and precipitation lead to increased runoff. In the GR4J-6-LSTM model, Tmin (minimum temperature) and the hydrological feature variable Qsim exhibited a strong positive correlation with simulated runoff, as Tmin and Qsim increased, they promoted stronger flow production. This study provides a framework for runoff simulation in snowmelt river basins, offering a reference for projecting extreme hydrological events under climate change.},

   abstract = {Kerala, a coastal state in India characterized by its humid tropical monsoon climate, is profoundly influenced by the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea. Kerala receives significant rainfall during both the southwest monsoon (June to September, JJAS) and the northeast monsoon (October to December, OND) seasons. Given the substantial impact of rainfall on the state's economy and livelihoods, accurate precipitation forecasting is of critical importance. Although Kerala's annual rainfall is approximately 2.5 times higher than the national average, the state frequently experiences water scarcity due to rapid runoff into the Arabian Sea. This study builds upon previous research concerning Kerala's rainfall patterns and introduces a novel approach to improving rainfall predictions. Usage of a hybrid model that integrates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, demonstrates enhanced precision in forecasting. Thus, by integrating empirical data analysis with advanced deep learning techniques, this research offers a robust framework for predicting rainfall in Kerala, making a significant contribution to the field of climate informatics and providing practical benefits for the region's economy and environmental management.},

Statistical models and machine learning algorithms automatically learn and improve based on data. Deep learning uses neural networks to learn complex data patterns and relationships. A combination of satellite imagery, radar data, and ground-based observations are used and using aircraft or satellites, and remote sensing (RS) collects data on distant objects or locations. Satellites and radar are used to gather regional precipitation data for hybrid models. An algorithm trained on historical rainfall measurements would then process the data. Using remote monitoring instrument input features, the machine-learning model can predict precipitation. Evaluation of machine learning regression methods is based on the degree of agreement between predicted and observed values. The RMSE, R2, and MAE statistical measures check on the precision of a prediction or forecasting model. Machine learning excels at rainfall prediction regardless of climate or timescale. As one of the more popular models for predicting rainfall, the LSTM models demonstrate their superiority.

   abstract = {Accurate rainfall prediction remains a challenging problem because of the high volatility and complicated essence of atmospheric data. This study proposed a hybrid model (DSP) that combines the advantages of discrete wavelet transform (DWT), support vector regression (SVR), and Prophet to forecast rainfall data. First, the rainfall time series is decomposed into high-frequency and low-frequency subseries using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The SVR and Prophet models are then used to predict high-frequency and low-frequency subsequences, respectively. Finally, the predicted rainfall is determined by summing the predicted values of each subsequence. A case study in China is conducted from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2016. The results show that the DSP model provides excellent prediction, with RMSE, MAE, and R2 values of 6.17, 3.3, and 0.75, respectively. The DSP model yields higher prediction accuracy than the three baseline models considered, with the prediction accuracy ranking as follows: DSP > SSP > Prophet > SVR. In addition, the DSP model is quite stable and can achieve good results when applied to rainfall data from various climate types, with RMSEs ranging from 1.24 to 7.31, MAEs ranging from 0.52 to 6.14, and R2 values ranging from 0.62 to 0.75. The proposed model may provide a novel approach for rainfall forecasting and is readily adaptable to other time series predictions. © 2023 by the authors.},

We developed a new hybrid SWAT-WSVR model based on 12 hydrological sites in the Illinois River watershed (IRW), U.S., that integrated the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with a Support Vector Regression (SVR) calibration method coupled with discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to better support modeling watersheds with limited data availability. Wavelet components of the simulated streamflow from the SWAT-Calibration Uncertainty Procedure (SWAT-CUP) and precipitation time series were used as inputs to SVR to build a hybrid SWAT-WSVR. We examined the performance and potential of the SWAT-WSVR model and compared it with observations, SWAT-CUP, and SWAT-SVR using statistical metrics, Taylor diagrams, and hydrography. The results showed that the average of RMSE-observation’s standard deviation ratio (RSR), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and root mean square error (RMSE) from SWAT-WSVR is 0.02, 1.00, −0.15, and 0.27 m3 s−1 in calibration and 0.14, 0.98, −1.88, and 2.91 m3 s−1 in validation on 12 sites, respectively. Compared with the other two models, the proposed SWAT-WSVR model possessed lower discrepancy and higher accuracy. The rank of the overall performance of the three SWAT-based models during the whole study period was SWAT-WSVR > SWAT-SVR > SWAT-CUP. The developed SWAT-WSVR model supplies an additional calibration approach that can improve the accuracy of the SWAT streamflow simulation of watersheds with limited data. © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Drought prediction plays an important guiding role in drought risk management. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) is a popular meteorological drought indicator to measure the degree of drought. The SPI time series is non-stationary, whereas the conventional artificial neural network (ANN) model has limitations to predict non-stationary time series. To overcome this limitation, it is essential to investigate input data preprocessing to improve the ANN model. In this paper, a hybrid model coupled with singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and backpropagation ANN is proposed (SSA-BP-ANN). The advantage of this model is that the SSA of finite-length SPI sequences does not require the adoption of boundary extensions to suppress boundary effects, while the most predictable components of the SPI can be efficiently extracted and incorporated into the model. The proposed SSA-BP-ANN model is tested in case studies at three meteorological stations in Northern Shannxi Province, China. The results show that the SSA-BP-ANN model can produce more accurate predictions than the BP-ANN model. In addition, the performance improvement of SSA on the BP-ANN model is slightly better than wavelet decomposition and empirical mode decomposition. This new hybrid prediction model has great potential for promoting drought early warning in arid regions. © 2022 The Authors},

In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence methods based on data mining theory has increasingly attracted attention. The goal of this research is to evaluate and compare the performance of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Wavelet-ANFIS models based on FCM for simulation/prediction of monthly GWL in the Maragheh plain in northwestern Iran. A 22-year dataset (1996–2018) including hydrological parameters such as monthly precipitation (P) and GWL from 25 observation wells was used as models input data. To improve the prediction accuracy of hybrid Wavelet-ANFIS model, different mother wavelets and different numbers of clusters and decomposition levels were investigated. The new hybrid model with Sym4-mother wavelet, two clusters and a decomposition level equal to 3 showed the best performance. The maximum values of R2 in the training and testing phases were 0.997 and 0.994, respectively, and the best RMSE values were 0.05 and 0.08 m, respectively. By comparing the results of the ANFIS and hybrid Wavelet-ANFIS models, it can be deduced that a hybrid model is an acceptable method in modeling of GWL because it employs both the wavelet transform and FCM clustering technique. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper examines the applicability of several forecasting models based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) in annual rainfall forecasting, and a novel hybrid precipitation prediction framework (WPD-ELM) is proposed coupling extreme learning machine (ELM) and WPD. The works of this paper can be described as follows: (a)WPD is used to decompose the original precipitation data into several sub-layers; (b) ELM model, autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) are employed to realize the forecasting computation for the decomposed series; (c) the results are integrated to attain the final prediction. Four evaluation indexes (RMSE, MAE, R, and NSEC) are adopted to assess the performance of the models. The results indicate that the WPD-ELM model outperforms other models used in this paper and WPD can significantly enhance the performance of forecasting models. In conclusion, WPD-ELM can be a promising alternative for annual precipitation forecasting and WPD is an effective data pre-processing technique in producing convincing forecasting models. © 2021 by the authors.

This study introduces a novel hybrid model, combining wavelet transform with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, known as Wavelet ARIMA (W-ARIMA), to enhance drought prediction accuracy. We meticulously analyze monthly precipitation data from January 1970 to December 2019 in Kabul, Afghanistan, focusing on multiple time scales (SPI 3, SPI 6, SPI 9, SPI 12). Comparative assessment against the conventional ARIMA approach reveals the superior performance of our W-ARIMA model. Key statistical indicators, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), underscore the improvements achieved by the W-ARIMA model, notably in SPI 12 forecasting. Additionally, we evaluate performance using metrics like R-square, NSE, PBIAS, and KGE, consistently demonstrating the W-ARIMA model’s superiority. This substantial enhancement highlights the innovative model’s clear superiority in drought forecasting for Kabul, Afghanistan. Our research underscores the critical significance of this hybrid model in addressing the challenges posed by drought within the broader context of climate change and water resource management. © 2023 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Analyses based on precipitation data may be limited by the quality of the data, the size of the available historical series and the efficiency of the adopted methodologies; these factors are especially limiting when conducting analyses at the daily scale. Thus, methodologies are sought to overcome these barriers. The objective of this work is to develop a hybrid model through the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) to estimate daily rainfall in homogeneous regions of the Tocantins-Araguaia Hydrographic Region (TAHR) in the Amazon (Brazil). Data series from the Climate Prediction Center morphing (CMORPH) satellite products and rainfall data from the National Water Agency (ANA) were divided into seasonal periods (dry and rainy), which were adopted to train the model and for model forecasting. The results show that the hybrid model had a good performance when forecasting daily rainfall using both databases, indicated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients (0.81-0.95), thus, the hybrid model is considered to be potentially useful for modelling daily rainfall. © 2021 Evanice Pinheiro Gomes et al., published by Sciendo 2021.},

   abstract = {Downscaling of daily precipitation from Global Circulation Models (GCMs)-predictors at a station level, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, has remained a formidable challenge yet. The current study aims at proposing a coupled model of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Quantile Mapping (QM) for statistical downscaling of daily precipitation. Given the historic (1978–2005) and future (2006–2100) predictors of eight-selected GCMs under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, a viable DWT-ANN model was developed for each station. Subsequently, we linked QM to DWT-ANN for bias correction and drizzle effect postprocessing of the DWT-ANN-historic/future projected precipitation. The skill of DWT-ANN-QM was demonstrated using various evaluation metrics, including Taylor diagram, Quantile–Quantile plot, Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function, and wet/dry spell analysis. We appraise the efficacy of the coupled model at 12 weather stations over the Gharehsoo River Basin (GRB) in northwestern Iran. Compared to the observed wet/dry spells, the dry-spells were better simulated via DWT-ANN-QM rather than the wet-spells wherein length and exceedance probability of the spells were overestimated. Results indicated that the future precipitation across the GRB will rise, on average, from 10 to 17% depending on weather station. Seasonal spatial distribution of the middle future (2041–2070) precipitation illustrated that an increase for fall and winter, especially, is expected, whereas the amount of the future spring and summer precipitation is projected to be declined. Having been developed and tested in a semi-arid basin, the efficacy of the coupled model should be further assessed in more humid climates. © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {The conceptual hydrologic model has been widely used for flood forecasting, while long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network has been demonstrated a powerful ability to tackle time-series predictions. This study proposed a novel hybrid model by combining the Xinanjiang (XAJ) conceptual model and LSTM model (XAJ-LSTM) to achieve precise multi-step-ahead flood forecasts. The hybrid model takes flood forecasts of the XAJ model as the input variables of the LSTM model to enhance the physical mechanism of hydrological modeling. Using the XAJ and the LSTM models as benchmark models for comparison purposes, the hybrid model was applied to the Lushui reservoir catchment in China. The results demonstrated that three models could offer reasonable multi-step-ahead flood forecasts and the XAJ-LSTM model not only could effectively simulate the long-term dependence between precipitation and flood datasets, but also could create more accurate forecasts than the XAJ and the LSTM models. The hybrid model maintained similar forecast performance after feeding with simulated flood values of the XAJ model during horizons t + Dt to t + 4Dt. The study concludes that the XAJ-LSTM model that integrates the conceptual model and machine learning can raise the accuracy of multi-step-ahead flood forecasts while improving the interpretability of data-driven model internals. © 2021 The Authors},

The spatial features of precipitation and underlying surface of the basin can be extracted by CNN, while the temporal features of the input data series can be captured by the LSTM. The hybrid model is compared with the single models (CNN, LSTM), and hybrid model performances under different driven data are also investigated. New hydrological insights for the region: Driven by the in-situ precipitation, grid-based precipitation (GPM) and SM data, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieved the best prediction result with NSE of 0.834, outperforming the single LSTM model (NSE=0.510) and the CNN model (NSE=0.612). It indicates that the hybrid model captures the spatiotemporal change features of precipitation and underlying surface of the basin. When using only GPM and SM data as input, the hybrid model achieved comparable result with NSE of 0.827. It implies that GPM could serve as a good alternative of in-situ precipitation and SM could provide additional value to improve prediction. This study highlights the value of using multiple grid-based data to drive the hybrid model, which provides new insights into runoff prediction in data-scarce regions. © 2024 The Authors},

This study introduced a Daily Precipitation Forecasting Hybrid (DPFH) technique for central Thailand, which uses three different input-based models to improve prediction accuracy. • The proposed methods precisely combine the biorthogonal wavelet transformation (BWT) function through BWT-RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Networks) and (BWT-LSTM-RNN)Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks. Comparative analyses reveal that hybrid models perform better than conventional deep LSTM-RNN and Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). Although MLP-ANN showed moderate effectiveness, LSTM-RNN displayed notable enhancements, particularly evidenced by an impressive R2 (0.96) in Model M-2. • The combination of BWT-LSTM-RNN yielded substantial enhancements, constantly surpassing standalone models. Specifically, DPFH-3 exhibited superior performance across multiple observation stations. • The findings emphasize the efficiency of the BWT-LSTM-RNN models in capturing varied precipitation patterns, highlighting their potential to significantly improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts, particularly in the context of water resource management in central Thailand. © 2024 The Authors},

The considered DNN models include long-short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), bidirectional-GRU (Bi-GRU), one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN1D) and other hybrid configurations such as CNN-LSTM and CNN-BiLSTM. A dataset of daily GHI recordings collected during January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2020 from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at an arid location (Hail, Saudi Arabia) is used to develop and compare the above DNN-based models. The parameters affecting the accuracy of the models have been also deeply analyzed. Only historical values of daily GHI have been used to build the DNN-based models whereas additional weather parameters such as air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity are not considered in this work. Keras library and Python language have been used to develop and compare the GHI forecasting models. The evaluation metrics such as correlation coefficient ( r ), Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), cumulative distribution function (CDF) and standard deviation ( \sigma ) are opted to evaluate the performance of the prediction models.

   abstract = {By relying on the advantages of a uniform site distribution and continuous observation of the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) system, real-time high-precision Global Navigation Satellite System/Precipitable Water Vapor (GNSS/PWV) data interpretation can be carried out to achieve accurate monitoring of regional water vapor changes. The study of the atmospheric water vapor content and distribution changes is the basis for the realization of rainfall forecasting and water vapor circulation research. Such research can provide data support for the effective forecasting of regional precipitation in megacities and the construction of a more sensitive flood prevention and warning system. Nowadays, a single model is often adopted for GNSS/PWV time series. This makes it challenging to match the high randomness characteristic of water vapor change. This study proposes a hybrid model that takes into account the linear and nonlinear aspects of water vapor data by using complete empirical mode decomposition (CEEMDAN) of adaptive noise, differential autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and the long-short-term memory network (LSTM). The CEEMDAN is used to decompose the water vapor data series. Then, the high- and low-frequency data are modeled separately, reducing the sequence’s complexity and non-stationarity. In selecting the prediction model, we use the ARIMA model for the high-frequency series and the ARIMA–GWO–LSTM ensemble model for the low-frequency sub-series and residual series. The model is verified using GNSS/PWV time series data collected at the Hong Kong CORS station in July 2021. The results show the following: (1) The LSTM model optimized by the grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) is comparable with the single LSTM model in the low-frequency sequence prediction process, and the error items are reduced by 30% after calculation. (2) During the process from CEEMDAN decomposition to the use of the combination model for prediction, the accuracy evaluation indexes of the station increase by more than 20%. The interpolation method can accurately determine the regional water vapor spatial variation, which is of practical significance for local rainfall forecasting. High-frequency data obtained by CEEMDAN decomposition demonstrate the dramatic changes in water vapor before and after the rainfall, which can provide ideas for improving the accuracy of rainfall forecasting. © 2022 by the authors.},

Here we present a hybrid network of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for river flow prediction. The hybridization enables accurate identification of the spatial and temporal features in precipitation. A shortcut layer is used as an additional channel of passing input features through the deep network to increase feature diversity. The flows in Hun River Basin, China are predicted using the trained hybrid network and are compared with the results from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results demonstrate the learning efficiency of the hybrid network is greatly affected by its structure and parameters, including the number of convolutional layers and LSTM cell layers, the step size of pooling and training data size. Further, the shortcut layer can effectively solve the diversity reduction problem in a deep network. The hybrid network is shown to have a similar predictive performance to SWAT but is superior in wet seasons due to its nonlinear learning ability.

   abstract = {Droughts have negative impacts on agricultural productivity and economic growth. Effective monitoring and accurate forecasting of drought occurrences and trends are crucial for minimizing drought losses and mitigating their spatial and temporal effects. In this study, trend dynamics in monthly total rainfall time series measured at Cape Town International Airport were analyzed using the Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Modified Mann–Kendall (MMK) test and innovative trend analysis (ITA). Additionally, we utilized a hybrid prediction method that combined the model with the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) technique, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network (i.e., CEEMDAN-ARIMA-LSTM) to forecast SPI values of 6-, 9-, and 12-months using rainfall data between 1995 and 2020 from Cape Town International Airport meteorological rainfall stations. In terms of trend analysis of the monthly total rainfall, the MK and MMK tests detected a significant decreasing trend with negative z-scores of −3.7541 and −4.0773, respectively. The ITA also indicated a significant downward trend of total monthly rainfall, especially for values between 10 and 110 mm/month. The SPI forecasting results show that the hybrid model (CEEMDAN-ARIMA-LSTM) had the highest prediction accuracy of the models at all SPI timescales. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of the CEEMDAN-ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model are 0.121, 0.044, and 0.042 for SPI-6, SPI-9, and SPI-12, respectively. The directional symmetry for this hybrid model is 0.950, 0.917, and 0.950, for SPI-6, SPI-9, and SPI-12, respectively. This indicates that this is the most suitable model for forecasting long-term drought conditions in Cape Town. Additionally, models that use a decomposition step and those that are built by combining independent models seem to produce improved SPI prediction accuracy. © 2024 by the authors.},

To address this challenge, this study introduces an innovative hybrid model that synergistically harnesses the strengths of multi-source remote sensing data, a physically based hydrological model (i.e., Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY)), and ML techniques. This novel approach employs MODIS snow cover data and remote sensing-derived glacier mass balance data to calibrate the SPHY model. The SPHY model primarily generates baseflow, rain runoff, snowmelt runoff, and glacier melt runoff. These outputs are then utilized as extra inputs for the ML models, which consist of Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GDBT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Transformer (TF). These ML models reconstruct the intricate relationship between inputs and streamflow. The performance of these six hybrid models and SPHY model is comprehensively explored in the Manas River basin in Central Asia. The findings underscore that the SPHY-RF model performs better in simulating and predicting daily streamflow and flood events than the SPHY model and the other five hybrid models. Compared to the SPHY model, SPHY-RF significantly reduces RMSE (55.6%) and PBIAS (62.5%) for streamflow, as well as reduces RMSE (65.8%) and PBIAS (73.51%) for floods. By utilizing bootstrap sampling, the 95% uncertainty interval for SPHY-RF is established, effectively covering 87.65% of flood events. Significantly, the SPHY-RF model substantially improves the simulation of streamflow and flood events that the SPHY model struggles to capture, indicating its potential to enhance the accuracy of flood prediction within data-scarce glacial river basins. This study offers a framework for robust flood simulation and forecasting within glacial river basins, offering opportunities to explore extreme hydrological events in a warming climate. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The ability to accurately predict the yields of different crop genotypes in response to weather variability is crucial for developing climate resilient crop cultivars. Genotype-environment interactions introduce large variations in crop-climate responses, and are hard to factor in to breeding programs. Data-driven approaches, particularly those based on machine learning, can help guide breeding efforts by factoring in genotype-environment interactions when making yield predictions. Using a new yield dataset containing 93,028 records of soybean hybrids across 159 locations, 28 states, and 13 years, with 5,838 distinct genotypes and daily weather data over a 214-day growing season, we developed two convolutional neural network (CNN) models: one that integrates CNN and fully-connected neural networks (CNN model), and another that incorporates a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer after the CNN component (CNN-LSTM model). By applying the Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), we combined the CNN-based models and optimized their weights to improve overall predictive performance. The dataset provided unique genotype information on seeds, enabling an investigation into the potential of planting different genotypes based on weather variables. We employed the proposed GEM model to identify the best-performing genotypes across various locations and weather conditions, making yield predictions for all potential genotypes in each specific setting. To assess the performance of the GEM model, we evaluated it on unseen genotype-location combinations, simulating real-world scenarios where new genotypes are introduced. By combining the base models, the GEM ensemble approach provided much better prediction accuracy compared to using the CNN-LSTM model alone and slightly better accuracy than the CNN model, as measured by both RMSE and MAE on the validation and test sets. The proposed data-driven approach can be valuable for genotype selection in scenarios with limited testing years. In addition, we explored the impact of incorporating state-level soil data alongside the weather, location, genotype and year variables. Due to data constraints, including the absence of latitude and longitude details, we used uniform soil variables for all locations within the same state. This limitation restricted our spatial information to state-level knowledge. Our findings suggested that integrating state-level soil variables did not substantially enhance the predictive capabilities of the models. We also performed a feature importance analysis using RMSE change to identify crucial predictors. Location showed the highest RMSE change, followed by genotype and year. Among weather variables, maximum direct normal irradiance (MDNI) and average precipitation (AP) displayed higher RMSE changes, indicating their importance.

   abstract = {A warming climate will intensify the water cycle, resulting in an exacerbation of water resources crises and flooding risks in the Lancang–Mekong River Basin (LMRB). The mitigation of these risks requires accurate streamflow and flood simulations. Process-based and data-driven hydrological models are the two major approaches for streamflow simulations, while a hybrid of these two methods promises advantageous prediction accuracy. In this study, we developed a hybrid physics-data (HPD) methodology for streamflow and flood prediction under the physics-guided neural network modeling framework. The HPD methodology leveraged simulation information from a process-based model (i.e., VIC-CaMa-Flood) along with the meteorological forcing information (precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed) to simulate the daily streamflow series and flood events, using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. This HPD methodology outperformed the pure process-based VIC-CaMa-Flood model or the pure observational data driven LSTM model by a large margin, suggesting the usefulness of introducing physical regularization in data-driven modeling, and the necessity of observation-informed bias cor-rection for process-based models. We further developed a gradient boosting tree method to measure the information contribution from the process-based model simulation and the meteorological forcing data in our HPD methodology. The results show that the process-based model simulation contributes about 30% to the HPD outcome, outweighing the information contribution from each of the meteorological forcing variables (<20%). Our HPD methodology inherited the physical mechanisms of the process-based model, and the high predictability capability of the LSTM model, offering a novel way for making use of incomplete physical understanding, and insufficient data, to enhance streamflow and flood predictions. © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {Modeling and forecasting electricity consumption (EC) help industry managers make better strategic decisions. In this study, a hybrid approach for predicting EC is proposed which first EC is decomposed into approximate and detail parts based on wavelet transfer (WT). Next, the modeling of wavelet components is accomplished based on the adaptive WT (AWT)-long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX)-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) type models. The key concept of AWT–LSTM is adding an optimal set of adaptive layers through which AWT–LSTM can automatically concentrate on various frequency components based on the dynamic evolution of the input sequence revealing the multi-frequency pattern of EC. Then, the components are predicted separately and eventually, the results are combined nonlinearly through random forest (RF) algorithm. Besides the lag calendar setting, the affecting exogenous variables are applied on the electricity consumption in the structure of hybrid models which include humidity, water precipitation, solar radiation, effective temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. To measure the predictive power, the proposed models were tested using a 24 h ahead forecasting horizon using a sample rate of 30 min in two different seasons (winter and summer). The empirical results indicate the hybrid model of AWT–LSTM-ARIMAX-exponential (EGARCH) in mean-RF with root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.536, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 1.276, normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) = 0.0116, normalized RMSE (NRMSE) = 0.0143, relative RMSE (RRMSE) = 0.1906, Theil's inequality coefficient (TIC) = 0.01025, sum of squared errors (SSE) = 113.2 values in summer test and RMSE = 1.249, MAPE = 0.869, NMAE = 0.0078, NRMSE = 0.0092, RRMSE = 0.1223, TIC = 0.00533, SSE = 74.9 values in winter test outperforms the benchmark models (WT-feedforward neural network (FFNN)-RF, WT-LSTM-RF, WT-exponential smoothing (ETS)-RF, and WT-seasonal ARIMA with explanatory variable (SARIMAX)-GARCH types models) and alternative filtering methods (Curvelet, Ridgelet, and Contourlet). The results suggest that employing the WT for the decomposition of data and RF for the nonlinear aggregation of sub-signals (predicted values of detail and approximate parts) can significantly improve the prediction power of predictive models. © 2022},

   abstract = {In current studies, India is a farming country, and the accomplishment or disappointment of the crop mainly depends on the country's rainfall design. Generally, India's farming production is primarily based on the nature of the precipitation of the rainy season rainfall. The rainy season is the primary source of water in India. Regular rainfall forecasting is the primary source for crop development. Several analyses have defined the direct effect of rainwater on harvests. The main motive of this research work is proper and early rainfall prediction, which is helpful to people who live in northeast regions inclined to natural disasters like floods, etc. It helps agriculture with decision-making in their crop and water management (WM) using extensive dataset analysis that generates maximum terms of production for farmers and profits. This proposed work introduced an improved rainfall forecasting framework, a hybrid feature selection gradient-based RNN (HFSGRNN) model with an RNN algorithm. The research uses the HFSGRNN model steps, such as initial data preprocessing steps, which are used for forecasting rainfall, handling missing value outliers, and typecasting the rainfall dataset collected from the government site. After that, an HFSGRNN method is implemented to select the valuable using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and optimal solutions calculated by particle swarm optimization (PSO) from the preprocessed data. The hybrid optimized feature sets are fed to the rainfall forecasting of the RNN classifier. Lastly, the valuable feature sets are forecasted using decision-making, and the simulation outcome shows that the research approach performed better in rainfall forecasting. The simulation results define that the HFSGRNN model delivered the minimum value of Root means square error (RMSE= 0.10) and maximum value of accuracy rate (acc = 98.1%) compared with existing methods, such as logistic regression (LR), Long Short Term –Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-CNN), etc. The outcomes of the research analysis will help the farmers accept efficient modeling methods for forecasting long-term seasonal rainfall. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

   abstract = {Accurate drought prediction is crucial for enhancing resilience and managing water resources. Developing robust forecasting models and understanding the variables influencing their outcomes are essential. This study developed models that integrate wavelet transformation (WT) with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models, increasing prediction accuracy. This study investigates the prediction of meteorological droughts using standalone bootstrapped random forest (BRF) and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) models, compared to wavelet-decomposed hybrid models (WBRF, WBi-LSTM). These models were evaluated in the Mun River Basin, Thailand, utilizing monthly meteorological data (1993-2022) from the Thai Meteorological Department. The predictions were assessed using statistical metrics (R2, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE). For the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the hybrid WBRF model consistently outperformed the standalone BRF across various metrics and timescales, demonstrating higher R2 (0.89-0.97 for SPI-3) and lower error metrics (MAE: 0.144-0.21 for SPI-6, RMSE: 0.2-0.3 for SPI-12). Similarly, the hybrid WBi-LSTM model outperformed the standalone Bi-LSTM in SPI predictions, exhibiting higher R2 (0.87-0.91 for SPI-3) and lower error metrics (MAE: 0.19-0.23 for SPI-6, RMSE: 0.27-0.81 for SPI-12) across all timescales. This trend was also observed for the China Z-index, Modified China Z-index, Hutchinson Drought Severity Index, and Rainfall Anomaly Index, where hybrid models achieved superior performance compared to standalone models. The WBi-LSTM model emerged as the preferred choice across different timespans. The integration of WT enhanced the predictive accuracy of hybrid models, making them effective tools for drought prediction. © 2024 Author(s).},

Using one-week data collected from open and multiple sources, including telecommunication activity, weather, point of interest, buildings, roads, and land use in Milan, Italy, we develop a hybrid method combining cellular automata (CA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict population distribution with fine temporal and spatial granularity. Specifically, the convolutional autoencoder and LightGBM are applied to identify missing building types based on the pedestrian shed. The LSTM learns the transition rules of CA and Shapley additive explanations value is used for variable importance analysis. Results demonstrate that the combination of convolutional autoencoder and LightGBM is effective in building type prediction. The proposed model for population distribution prediction outperforms LSTM, the combination of CA and neural network, and the combination of CA and LightGBM by at least 5–10%. A variable importance analysis reveals that temporal variables are the most significant for prediction, followed by spatial and natural variables.

   abstract = {Maintaining a steady power supply requires accurate forecasting of solar irradiance, since clean energy resources do not provide steady power. The existing forecasting studies have examined the limited effects of weather conditions on solar radiation such as temperature and precipitation utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN), but no comprehensive study has been conducted on concentrations of air pollutants along with weather conditions. This paper proposes a hybrid approach based on deep learning, expanding the feature set by adding new air pollution concentrations, and ranking these features to select and reduce their size to improve efficiency. In order to improve the accuracy of feature selection, a maximum-dependency and minimum-redundancy (mRMR) criterion is applied to the constructed feature space to identify and rank the features. The combination of air pollution data with weather conditions data has enabled the prediction of solar irradiance with a higher accuracy. An evaluation of the proposed approach is conducted in Istanbul over 12 months for 43791 discrete times, with the main purpose of analyzing air data, including particular matter (PM10 and PM25), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NOX), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2) using a CNN, a long short-term memory network (LSTM), and MRMR feature extraction. Compared with the benchmark models with root mean square error (RMSE) results of 76.2, 60.3, 41.3, 32.4, there is a significant improvement with the RMSE result of 5.536. This hybrid model presented here offers high prediction accuracy, a wider feature set, and a novel approach based on air concentrations combined with weather conditions for solar irradiance prediction. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

   abstract = {RH is a physical quantity measuring atmospheric water vapor content. Predicting RH is of great importance in weather, climate, industrial production, crops, human health, and disease transmission, since it is helpful in making critical decisions. In this paper, the effects of covariates and error correction on relative humidity (RH) prediction have been studied, and a hybrid model based on seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, cointegration (EG), and error correction model (ECM) named SARIMA-EG-ECM (SEE) has been proposed. The prediction model was performed in the meteorological observations of Hailun Agricultural Ecology Experimental Station, China. Based on the SARIMA model, the meteorological variables that interact with RH were used as covariates to perform EG tests. A cointegration model has been constructed. It revealed that RH had a cointegration relationship with air temperature (TEMP), dew point temperature (DEWP), precipitation (PRCP), atmospheric pressure (ATMO), sea-level pressure (SLP), and 40 cm soil temperature (40ST), which revealed the long-term equilibrium relationship between series. An ECM was established which indicated that the current fluctuations of DEWP, ATMO, and SLP have a significant impact on the current fluctuations of RH. The established ECM describes the short-term fluctuation relationship between the series. With the increase of the forecast horizon from 6 to 12 months, the prediction performance of the SEE model decreased slightly. A comparative study has also been introduced, indicating that the SEE performs superior to SARIMA and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

   abstract = {Extreme precipitation events bring considerable risks to the natural ecosystem and human life. Investigating the spatial-temporal characteristics of extreme precipitation and predicting it quantitatively are critical for the flood prevention and water resources planning and management. In this study, daily precipitation data (1957–2019) were collected from 24 meteorological stations in the Weihe River Basin (WRB), Northwest China and its surrounding areas. We first analyzed the spatial-temporal change of precipitation extremes in the WRB based on space- time cube (STC), and then predicted precipitation extremes using long short-term memory (LSTM) network, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-LSTM-ARIMA models. The precipitation extremes increased as the spatial variation from northwest to southeast of the WRB. There were two clusters for each extreme precipitation index, which were distributed in the northwestern and southeastern or northern and southern of the WRB. The precipitation extremes in the WRB present a strong clustering pattern. Spatially, the pattern of only high-high cluster and only low-low cluster were primarily located in lower reaches and upper reaches of the WRB, respectively. Hot spots (25.00%–50.00%) were more than cold spots (4.17%–25.00%) in the WRB. Cold spots were mainly concentrated in the northwestern part, while hot spots were mostly located in the eastern and southern parts. For different extreme precipitation indices, the performances of the different models were different. The accuracy ranking was EEMD-LSTM-ARIMA > LSTM > ARIMA in predicting simple daily intensity index (SDII) and consecutive wet days (CWD), while the accuracy ranking was LSTM > EEMD-LSTM-ARIMA > ARIMA in predicting very wet days (R95P). The hybrid EEMD-LSTM-ARIMA model proposed was generally superior to single models in the prediction of precipitation extremes. © 2022, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Investigation of quantitative predictions of precipitation amounts and forecasts of drought events are conducive to facilitating early drought warnings. However, there has been limited research into or modern statistical analyses of precipitation and drought over Northeast China, one of the most important grain production regions. Therefore, a case study at three meteorological sites which represent three different climate types was explored, and we used time series analysis of monthly precipitation and the grey theory methods for annual precipitation during 1967–2017. Wavelet transformation (WT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long shortterm memory (LSTM) methods were utilized to depict the time series, and a new hybrid model wavelet-ARIMA-LSTM (W-AL) of monthly precipitation time series was developed. In addition, GM (1, 1) and DGM (1, 1) of the China Z-Index (CZI) based on annual precipitation were introduced to forecast drought events, because grey system theory specializes in a small sample and results in poor information. The results revealed that (1) W-AL exhibited higher prediction accuracy in monthly precipitation forecasting than ARIMA and LSTM; (2) CZI values calculated through annual precipitation suggested that more slight drought events occurred in Changchun while moderate drought occurred more frequently in Linjiang and Qian Gorlos; (3) GM (1, 1) performed better than DGM (1, 1) in drought event forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Floods are destructive natural calamities that destroy human lives and infrastructure across the world. Development of effective flood forecasting and prediction models is critical for minimising deaths and mitigating damages. This study employs hybrid deep learning Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms like LSTM, Convolution LSTM (Conv-LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM) to predict likelihood flood events using daily precipitation, daily temperature and daily relative humidity from two flood-forecasting stations i.e., Champua (Baitarani River, Odisha) and Jarikela (Brahmani River, Odisha) over a 20-year period. The results show that CNN-LSTM performed best followed by Conv-LSTM and LSTM in terms of R2 = 0.98055, 0.96564, and 0.93244, RMSE = 19.137, 35.635, and 49.347, MAE = 18.372, 33.766, and 47.058, NSE = 0.971, 0.9517 and 0.9257 respectively.

   abstract = {Due to population growth and human activities, water shortages have become an increasingly serious concern in the North China Plain, which has become the world’s largest underground water funnel. Because the yield per unit area, planting area of crops, and effective precipitation in the region are uncertain, it is not easy to plan the amount of irrigation water for crops. In order to improve the applicability of the uncertainty programming model, a hybrid LSTM-CPP-FPP-IPP model (long short-term memory, chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was developed to plan the irrigation water allocation of irrigation system under uncertainty. The LSTM (long short-term memory) model was used to predict crop yield per unit area, and CPP-FPP-IPP programming (chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was used to plan the crop area and the effective precipitation under uncertainty. The hybrid model was used for the crop production profit of winter wheat and summer corn in five cities in the North China Plain. The average absolute error between the model prediction value and the actual value of the yield per unit area of winter wheat and summer maize in four cities in 2020 was controlled within the range of 14.02 to 696.66 kg/hectare. It shows that the model can more accurately predict the yield per unit area of crops. The planning model for the benefit of irrigation water allocation generated three scenarios of rainfall level and four planting intentions, and compared the planned scenarios with the actual production benefits of the two crops in 2020. In a dry year, the possibility of planting areas for winter wheat and summer corn is optimized. Compared with the traditional deterministic planning method, the model takes into account the uncertain parameters, which helps decision makers seek better solutions under uncertain conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

   abstract = {In the context of climate change, droughts, increasingly frequent and severe, necessitate effective monitoring. Existing methods, such as drought indices and data-driven models, face important limitations. Drought indices are built on prior expert knowledge but lack calibration based on actual drought events, while data-driven models prioritize goodness of fit over real event identification, undermining their credibility and generalization, and also struggling to generalize from regional to large-scale contexts. To address these challenges, here we introduce a hybrid machine learning framework for time series that combines domain knowledge and observational data in a variational recurrent neural network. The network models the joint distribution of total precipitation, air temperature, and real drought events, providing accurate predictions and uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments focusing on a wide range of European drought events from 2011 to 2018 consistently show that our hybrid model surpasses both drought indices and data-driven models in terms of accuracy in drought detection, underlining its effectiveness, robustness, and stability. Our model achieves the best ROC-AUC (%) results in Afghanistan (79.7 ± 0.5), Italy (84.3 ± 0.6), Russia (89.4 ± 0.2), Europe-0 (84.3 ± 0.1), and Europe-1 (82.8 ± 0.4), effectively capturing the starting and ending times of drought events with lower uncertainty, and also generalizing better for unseen locations. © 2023},

We propose a hybrid model based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to improve drought prediction accuracy. Taking the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as an example, the prediction accuracy of the LSTM and CEEMD-LSTM models for the standardized precipitation index (SPI) on multiple timescales was compared and analyzed. Multiple evaluation metrics were used in the comparison of the models, such as the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results show that (1) with increasing timescale, the prediction accuracy of the LSTM and CEEMD-LSTM models gradually improves, and both reach their highest accuracy at the 24-month timescale; (2) the CEEMD can effectively stabilize the time-series, and the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model is higher than that of the single model at each timescale; and (3) the NSE values for the hybrid CEEMD-LSTM model at SPI24 were 0.895, 0.930, 0.908, and 0.852 for Fuhai, Kuerle, Yutian, and Hami station, respectively.

Consequently, the focal aims of the investigation are to assess the potential of machine learning models in forecasting irrigation water requirements (IWR) of snap beans by evolving multi-scenarios of inputs parameters to figure out the impact of meteorological, crop, and soil parameters on IWR. Six models were applied, support vector regressor (SVR), random forest (RF), deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and Hybrid CNN-LSTM. Ten variables including maximum and minimum temperature, Relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, a fraction of surface wetted and, exposed and soil wetted fraction were used as the input data for models with their combination, 8 input scenarios were designed. Overall models, the best scenario was scenario 4 (relative humidity, wind speed, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation), however, the best scenario for DNN and RF model was scenario 7 (root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wetted, exposed and soil wetted fraction). While the weakest one was the group of climatic factors in scenario 6 (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation). Among the models, the hybrid LTSM & CNN was the most accurate and the SVR model had the lowest estimation accuracy. The outcomes of this research work could set up a modeling strategy that would set in motion the improvement of efforts to identify the shortages in IWR forecasting, which sequentially may support alleviation strategies such as policies for sustainable water use and water resources management.

This study introduces a pioneering approach leveraging the available network of real-time monitoring stations and advanced machine learning algorithms that can accurately simulate spatial–temporal problems. The Spatio-Temporal Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (STA-GRU) model is renowned for its computational efficacy in forecasting streamflow events with a forecast horizon of 7 days. The novel integration of the groundwater level, precipitation, and river discharge as predictive variables offers a holistic view of the hydrological cycle, enhancing the model’s accuracy. Our findings reveal that for a 7-day forecasting period, the STA-GRU model demonstrates superior performance, with a notable improvement in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values and R-square ((Formula presented.)) alongside reductions in the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics, underscoring the model’s generalizability and reliability. Comparative analysis with seven conventional deep learning models, including the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNNLSTM), the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), the Spatio-Temporal Attention LSTM (STA-LSTM), the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), the Convolutional Neural Network GRU (CNNGRU), and the STA-GRU, confirms the superior predictive power of the STA-LSTM and STA-GRU models when faced with long-term prediction.

Given the substantial impact of rainfall on the state's economy and livelihoods, accurate precipitation forecasting is of critical importance. Although Kerala's annual rainfall is approximately 2.5 times higher than the national average, the state frequently experiences water scarcity due to rapid runoff into the Arabian Sea. This study builds upon previous research concerning Kerala's rainfall patterns and introduces a novel approach to improving rainfall predictions. Usage of a hybrid model that integrates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, demonstrates enhanced precision in forecasting.

   abstract = {Global climate change is an extensive phenomenon characterized by alterations in weather patterns, temperature trends, and precipitation levels. These variations substantially impact agrifood systems, encompassing the interconnected components of farming, food production, and distribution. This article analyzes 8,100 data points with 27 input features that quantify diverse aspects of the agrifood system’s contribution to predicted Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE). The study uses two machine learning algorithms, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF), as well as a hybrid approach (LSTM-RF). The LSTM-RF model integrates the strengths of LSTM and RF. LSTMs are adept at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data through memory cells, addressing the vanishing gradient problem. Meanwhile, with its ensemble learning approach, RF improves overall model performance and generalization by combining multiple weak learners. Additionally, RF provides insights into the importance of features, helping to understand the significant contributors to the model’s predictions. The results demonstrate that the LSTM-RF algorithm outperforms other algorithms (for the test subset, RMSE = 2.977 and R2 = 0.9990). These findings highlight the superior accuracy of the LSTM-RF algorithm compared to the individual LSTM and RF algorithms, with the RF algorithm being less accurate in comparison. As determined by Pearson correlation analysis, key variables such as on-farm energy use, pesticide manufacturing, and land use factors significantly influence GHGE outputs. Furthermore, this study uses a heat map to visually represent the correlation coefficient between the input variables and GHGE, enhancing our understanding of the complex interactions within the agrifood system. Understanding the intricate connection between climate change and agrifood systems is crucial for developing practices addressing food security and environmental challenges.

Results: Of all the features, the snow factor is used for the first time for commodity price forecasting. We used the LSTM-CNN model to evaluate the 5, 10, 15 and 20 weeks ahead forecasting and this hybrid model had the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) at 5, 10 and 15 weeks ahead of prediction. In addition, Shapley values were calculated to analyse the feature contribution of the LSTM-CNN model when forecasting the testing set. Based on the feature contribution, SWE ranked third, fifth and seventh in feature importance in the 5-week ahead forecast for corn, oats and wheat, respectively, and 7–8 places higher than total precipitation, indicating the potential use of SWE in grain price forecasting. Conclusion: The hybrid multivariate LSTM-CNN model outperformed other models and the newly involved climate data, SWE, showed the research potential of using snow as an input variable to predict grain prices over a multistep ahead time horizon. © 2023 The Authors.

   abstract = {The phenomenon of climate change exerts a substantial influence on the water consumption patterns of agricultural crops, thereby affecting the overall demand for irrigation water and regional water security. The quantitative assessment of future changes in irrigation water requirements has great importance for long-term water resource planning and the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus. This work employed a comprehensive approach (IWRAM) by integrating many models and techniques, including a global climate model (CanESM2), a statistical downscaling model (SDSM), a bias correction technique (QTM), a temperature-based crop phenology method (GDD), and deep learning technology (LSTM), in order to assess the potential impact of climate change on irrigation water demand. Therein, the QTM is utilized for the purpose of bias correction for the CanESM2-SDSMed daily precipitation data. Additionally, the LSTM is implemented to forecast ETo using the CanESM2-SDSMed daily temperature data. The findings from the case study conducted in the Jinghuiqu irrigation area (JIA) indicate that the application of bias correction techniques resulted in notable enhancements in the frequency distribution of predicted precipitation data. Consequently, this led to a more coherent relationship between historical observed data and anticipated future data, aligning them more closely with natural patterns. The deep learning technique exhibited a strong degree of concordance, suggesting its exceptional capacity for modeling daily reference evapotranspiration. By using the IWRAM model, relatively accurate predictions were made for future precipitation, temperature, crop evapotranspiration, and effective precipitation. Consequently, an estimation was made regarding the anticipated need for irrigation water in JIA. These results highlighted that JIA total irrigation water demand (or net irrigation water demand) will increase by 121 mm (net irrigation water: 189 mm) and 119 mm (net irrigation water: 187 mm) in the year 2050 under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Climate change could potentially affect the seasonal distribution of precipitation. Therefore, it is crucial for the authorities in JIA to not only take into account the overall irrigation water requirement but also give priority to the water requirements of each stage of crop growth. © 2023 The Authors},

   abstract = {Drought forecasting can effectively reduce the risk of drought. We proposed a hybrid model based on deep learning methods that integrates an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to improve the accuracy of short-term drought prediction. Taking China as an example, this paper compares and analyzes the prediction accuracy of six drought prediction models, namely, ARIMA, support vector regression (SVR), LSTM, ARIMA-SVR, least square-SVR (LS-SVR), and ARIMA-LSTM, for standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The performance of all the models was compared using measures of persistence, such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results show that all three hybrid models (ARIMA-SVR, LS-SVR, and ARIMA-LSTM) had higher prediction accuracy than the single model, for a given lead time, at different scales. The NSEs of the hybrid models for the predicted SPEI1 are 0.043, 0.168, and 0.368, respectively, and the NSEs of SPEI24 is 0.781, 0.543, and 0.93, respectively. This finding indicates that when the lead time remains unchanged, the hybrid model has high prediction accuracy for SPEI on long time scales and low prediction accuracy for SPEI on short time scales, and the prediction accuracy of the model with a 1-month lead time is higher than that of the model with a 2-month lead time. In addition, the ARIMA-LSTM model has the highest prediction accuracy at the 6-, 12-, and 24-month scales, indicating that the model is more suitable for the forecasting of long-term drought in China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {The estimation of groundwater levels is crucial and an important step in ensuring sustainable management of water resources. In this paper, selected piezometers of the Hamedan-Bahar plain located in west of Iran. The main objective of this study is to compare effect of various pre-processing methods on input data for different artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict groundwater levels (GWLs). The observed GWL, evaporation, precipitation, and temperature were used as input variables in the AI algorithms. Firstly, 126 method of data pre-processing was done by python programming which are classified into three classes: 1- statistical methods, 2- wavelet transform methods and 3- decomposition methods; later, various pre-processed data used by four types of widely used AI models with different kernels, which includes: Support Vector Machine (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long-Short Term memory (LSTM), and Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) - Artificial Neural Network (POA-ANN) are classified into three classes: 1- machine learning (SVR and ANN), 2- deep learning (LSTM) and 3- hybrid-ML (POA-ANN) models, to predict groundwater levels (GWLs). Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were used to evaluate and validate the predictive accuracy of algorithms. According to the results, based on summation (train and test phases) of AIC value of 1778 models, average of AIC values for ML, DL, hybrid-ML classes, was decreased to −25.3%, −29.6% and −57.8%, respectively. Therefore, the results showed that all data pre-processing methods do not lead to improvement of prediction accuracy, and they should be selected very carefully by trial and error. In conclusion, wavelet-ANN model with daubechies 13 and 25 neurons (db13_ANN_25) is the best model to predict GWL that has −204.9 value for AIC which has grown by 5.23% (−194.7) compared to the state without any pre-processing method (ANN_Relu_25). © 2024 The Authors},

   abstract = {Accurate precipitation prediction is very important for meteorological disaster prevention, water resources management, and agricultural decision making. To improve the accuracy of precipitation prediction, a hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), crested porcupine optimization algorithm (CPO), and long short-term memory model (LSTM) is proposed in this paper. The model first uses VMD to decompose the precipitation time series into intrinsic mode functions of different frequencies to capture the multi-scale characteristics of precipitation data. Then, the CPO algorithm is used to optimize LSTM adaptive parameters to improve the global search ability and robustness of the model. Finally, the decomposed precipitation component is input into the LSTM network to learn the spatiotemporal dependence relationship and improve the ability of long-term prediction. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional LSTM model, CPO-LSTM model, and VMD-LSTM model, the hybrid model achieves better performance in many evaluation indices and effectively improves the accuracy of precipitation prediction. The application of the model can provide an effective tool for the fields of meteorology and water resources management, as well as provide new ideas for related research. © 2024 Author(s).},

   abstract = {Using a comparison of three different major types, the best predictive model was determined. Statistical models and machine learning algorithms automatically learn and improve based on data. Deep learning uses neural networks to learn complex data patterns and relationships. A combination of satellite imagery, radar data, and ground-based observations are used and using aircraft or satellites, and remote sensing (RS) collects data on distant objects or locations. Satellites and radar are used to gather regional precipitation data for hybrid models. An algorithm trained on historical rainfall measurements would then process the data. Using remote monitoring instrument input features, the machine-learning model can predict precipitation. Evaluation of machine learning regression methods is based on the degree of agreement between predicted and observed values. The RMSE, R2, and MAE statistical measures check on the precision of a prediction or forecasting model. Machine learning excels at rainfall prediction regardless of climate or timescale. As one of the more popular models for predicting rainfall, the LSTM models demonstrate their superiority.

The model first uses the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and the Variational mode decomposition (VMD) decomposition method to denoise the input sequence to improve the accuracy and stability of the prediction. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to perform local feature extraction for each intrinsic mode function (IMF) after decomposition, and the features extracted by the CNN are fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) for sequence modeling. In addition, to further improve the performance of the model, an attention mechanism (AT) is used to dynamically adjust the weights of different time steps to better capture the important information in the sequences. Finally, it is applied to the precipitation prediction in Lanzhou City, and the results show that the proposed model has good prediction performance in precipitation prediction and outperforms other models.},

The stacked generalization ensemble consists of multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) combined through a meta-learning algorithm with/without rescanning input covariates. Sixteen input covariates, including 2 topographic features, 5 cloud properties, 5 environmental variables, 3 precipitation products (PPs), and inverse distance weighted (IDW) estimates as the precipitation background field were fed into the machine learning models. Hold out approach was adopted for performance evaluation in which 50% of the 174 gauges were used for training, and the rest was used for validation. The results indicated that the overall monthly MAE, RMSE, and rBias of the proposed stacking model for the validation dataset were 3.3%, 6.8%, and 50%, respectively, less than that of the RF model, which is the best individual model. Also, the stacking model outperformed LWLR by decreasing monthly MAE, RMSE, and rBias 10.7%, 19.1%, and 28.6%, respectively. Further analysis implied that (1) the stacked model is more robust than LWLR and less dependent on the density of gauges, thus suitable for areas with scarce gauge coverage; (2) comparing the spatial distribution of mean monthly precipitation maps, generated by stacking and LWLR models, stacking algorithm can successfully screen out the bulls' eyes of background IDW precipitation field, and both patterns are consistent with the topography of the area; and (3) the stacking scheme is found to have a better extrapolation ability than LWLR over high elevations.},

   abstract = {In recent years, due to the influence of human activities and changing climate conditions, precipitation time series have had increasing non-stationarity and randomness. Therefore, the scientific and accurate prediction of precipitation has become increasingly difficult. To improve precipitation prediction accuracy, nonlinear precipitation data was decomposed into several subcomponents via three decomposition methods (time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD), wavelet transform (WT), and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD)). Then, the Elman neural network (ENN) was used to construct TVF-EMD-ENN, WT-ENN, and CEEMD-ENN models to predict the subcomponents of precipitation. Finally, these three models were applied to the monthly and daily precipitation series from different meteorological stations. The results showed that TVF-EMD-ENN made relatively stable predictions for monthly and daily precipitation, and was better than WT-ENN, CEEMD-ENN, and other models. Predictions for Turpan station were generally poor, likely due to the discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices. Overall, the predictions by TVF-EMD-ENN were better, which was clearly reflected in the variance contribution rates (VCR) of high-frequency subcomponents, which were lower than those of WT and CEEMD. Parameter sensitivities of TVF-EMD indicated that the bandwidth threshold (BT) and the b-spline order (BSO) had a strong influence on model performance, and that BT and BSO should remain within 0.15–0.50 and 15–65, respectively. This study has provided a new approach to precipitation prediction that is better equipped to handle non-stationarity and randomness.},

   abstract = {<p>Precipitation forecast, especially on monthly and annual scales, is a key for optimal water resources management and planning, especially in semiarid climates with scarce water. The traditional hybrid models, in which two statistical models are used to separate and simulate linear and nonlinear components of precipitation time series, are still unable to provide accurate precipitation forecasts. This research aims to improve hybrid forecast models by combining one linear model and three nonlinear models with two preprocessing configurations: 1) using residuals of a linear model, representing the nonlinear component with different time steps and 2) using original time series of observations with different time steps, linear model simulations and residuals. Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) models were used individually as in the traditional hybrid models and combinedly as in the proposed hybrid models in this study. The performance of the hybrid models was improved by different methods such as inverse variance (Iv) as an error-based method, least square regression, genetic algorithm and SVR. Two weather stations of Tabriz (annual) and Rasht (monthly) in Iran were selected to test the developed models. The results showed that Theil’s coefficient, UII, decreased in configuration one for the Tabriz station by 9% and 15% for SVR and GMDH relative to GEP, suggesting that these two models performed better than GEP in the precipitation forecast. The error criteria used in developing the proposed hybrid models with all forecast combination methods better represent observations than the hybrid model. MSE decreased by 67% and Nash Sutcliffe increased by 5% in the Rasht station in configuration two when we combined the three models using GA to obtain the improved hybrid model relative to the hybrid model combined with SVR. Generally, the hybrid models when SVR, the error based methods and GA were incorporated showed better performance than traditional hybrid models. The developed models have implications for modeling highly nonlinear systems using full advantages of machine learning methods.</p>},

Afterward, we compared the best-optimized MLP to the application of the Extreme Learning Machine optimized by the Bat algorithm (Bat-ELM). Assessment of the various input combinations revealed that the NAO index was the most influential parameter in improving the modeling accuracy. The results indicated that the MLP-FFA model was superior to MLP-GA and MLP-PSO for the testing phase, presenting RMSE values equal to 33.36, 30.50, and 29.92 mm, respectively. The comparison between the best MLP model and Bat-ELM revealed the high performance of Bat-ELM for rainfall modeling at the Sebaou River basin, with RMSE reducing from 29.92 to 11.89 mm and NSE value from 0.902 to 0.985 during the testing phase.

   abstract = {Monitoring water resources requires accurate predictions of rainfall data. Our study introduces a novel deep learning model named the deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN)—temporal convolutional network (TCN) to remove redundant features and extract temporal features from rainfall data. The TCN model extracts temporal features, and the DRSN enhances the quality of the extracted features. Then, the DRSN–TCN is coupled with a random forest (RF) model to model rainfall data. Since the RF model may be unable to classify and predict complex patterns and data, our study develops the RF model to model outputs with high accuracy. Since the DRSN–TCN model uses advanced operators to extract temporal features and remove irrelevant features, it can improve the performance of the RF model for predicting rainfall. We use a new optimizer named the Gaussian mutation (GM)–orca predation algorithm (OPA) to set the DRSN–TCN–RF (DTR) parameters and determine the best input scenario. This paper introduces a new machine learning model for rainfall prediction, improves the accuracy of the original TCN, and develops a new optimization method for input selection. The models used the lagged rainfall data to predict monthly data. GM–OPA improved the accuracy of the orca predation algorithm (OPA) for feature selection. The GM–OPA reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) values of OPA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) by 1.4%–3.4% and 6.14–9.54%, respectively. The GM–OPA can simplify the modeling process because it can determine the most important input parameters. Moreover, the GM–OPA can automatically determine the optimal input scenario. The DTR reduced the testing mean absolute error values of the TCN–RAF, DRSN–TCN, TCN, and RAF models by 5.3%, 21%, 40%, and 46%, respectively.

   abstract = {In recent years, the application of machine learning methods in the prediction of hydrological processes such as precipitation has been widely considered. These methods can analyze large volumes of data and detect the existing trends and patterns. Therefore, in the present study, machine learning methods, including random forests (RF), Kstar algorithm and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were used to predict the precipitation of Sindh River basin in India during period of 1901 to 2020. In the next step, three distinct input scenarios include (i) using monthly precipitation data and considering the memory of time series up to 5 months delay, (ii) adding periodic term to the first scenario inputs and (iii) decomposing the data using the Daubechies 4 wavelet function and creating hybrid wavelet-learning machine (W-ML) models, were prepared and introduced to the models. The performance of each method was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Kling–Gupta efficiency score (KGE) and Willmott index (WI). The results showed that single models with the first scenario inputs (without taking into account the periodicity of the data) did not have good accuracy, but by adding the periodicity, the performance of these models was significantly improved, and the average value of KGE index for all studied stations increased from 0.466 to 0.672. It was also found that the GPR model for all stations could not have good performance and RF and Kstar models are the most appropriate methods for predicting precipitation in the Sindh River basin, respectively. With the application of the third scenario and the development of W-ML hybrid models, the accuracy of precipitation forecasting was significantly improved, especially the maximum precipitation values were estimated with higher accuracy than standalone models.},

   abstract = {Accurate precipitation forecasts are much attractive due to their complexity. This study aimed to use the hybrid Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model and machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to improve precipitation forecasts. Time variation analysis and time series decomposition were the two concepts applied to construct the hybrid models. The performance of the two concepts was evaluated with monthly precipitation time series of two stations in northern Iran. Time variation analysis of time series was conducted with the clustering analysis, which increased the accuracy of forecasting with 20.99% decrease in the geometric mean error ratio for the two stations. SVM model decreased the forecasted error compared to ANN in the internal process of time variation analysis. Average of Mean Relative Error (MRE) were MRE SVM = 0.72, MRE ANN = 0.89, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the two stations were MAE SVM = 18.02 and MAE ANN = 23.88. Therefore, SVM outperformed the ANN model. Comparison of the two hybrid models indicated that more accurate results belonged to the concept of time series decomposition (the decrease in root mean square error from time variation to time series decomposition concepts was 13.35%). Extracting the pattern of data with SARIMA-based hybrid model with time series decomposition improved the precipitation forecasting. Configurations related to nonlinear components of time series with time steps of residual had good performance (the average of agreement index was 0.9). The results suggest that the hybrid model can be a valuable and effective tool for decision processes, and time series decomposition to linear and nonlinear components has a better performance.},

To improve the accuracy of precipitation prediction, a hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), crested porcupine optimization algorithm (CPO), and long short-term memory model (LSTM) is proposed in this paper. The model first uses VMD to decompose the precipitation time series into intrinsic mode functions of different frequencies to capture the multi-scale characteristics of precipitation data. Then, the CPO algorithm is used to optimize LSTM adaptive parameters to improve the global search ability and robustness of the model. Finally, the decomposed precipitation component is input into the LSTM network to learn the spatiotemporal dependence relationship and improve the ability of long-term prediction. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional LSTM model, CPO-LSTM model, and VMD-LSTM model, the hybrid model achieves better performance in many evaluation indices and effectively improves the accuracy of precipitation prediction. The application of the model can provide an effective tool for the fields of meteorology and water resources management, as well as provide new ideas for related research.},

Therefore, development of monthly rainfall forecasting models in reservoir watersheds is essential for generating future rainfall amounts as an input to a water-resources-system simulation model to predict water shortage conditions. This research aims to examine the reliability of linking a data preprocessing method (singular spectrum analysis, SSA) with machine learning, least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and random forest (RF), for monthly rainfall forecasting in two reservoir watersheds (Deji and Shihmen reservoir watersheds) located in Taiwan. Merging SSA with LS-SVR and RF, the hybrid models (SSA-LSSVR and SSA-RF) were developed and compared with the standard models (LS-SVR and RF). The proposed models were calibrated and validated using the watersheds’ observed areal monthly rainfalls separated into 70 percent of data for calibration and 30 percent of data for validation. Model performances were evaluated using two accuracy measures, root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Results show that the hybrid models could efficiently forecast monthly rainfalls. Nonetheless, the performances of the hybrid models vary in both watersheds which suggests that prior knowledge about the watershed’s hydrological behavior would be helpful to implement the appropriate model. Overall, the hybrid models significantly surpass the standard models for the two studied watersheds, which indicates that the proposed models are a prudent modeling approach that could be employed in the current research regions for monthly rainfall forecasting.},

In this study, we applied two advanced Machine Learning Models (MLM) and latest General Circulation Models (GCM) to generate deterministic MPFs with a resolution of 0.5 across China. Then the Bayesian Joint Probability (BJP) modeling approach is employed to calibrate and generate corresponding ensemble MPFs. Raw and post-processing MPFs were put against gridded observations over the period of 1981-2015. The results indicated that: (1) for deterministic evaluation, the forecasting performance of MLMs was more inclined to generate random forecasts around the mean value, while the GCMs could reflect the increasing or decreasing trend of precipitation to some degree; (2) for probabilistic evaluation, the four BJP calibrated ensemble MPFs were unbiased and reliable. Compared to climatology, reliability and sharpness were all significantly improved. However, in terms of overall accuracy metric, the ensemble MPFs generated from MLMs were similar to climatology. In contrast, the ensemble MPFs generated from GCMs achieved better forecasting skill and were not dependent on forecasting regions and months. Moreover, the post-processing method is necessary to achieve not only bias-free but also reliable as well as skillful ensemble MPFs.},

Firstly, the monthly precipitation data series was decomposed into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residue with EEMD. Next, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models are used to predict components respectively. The prediction results of EEMD-ARIMA, EEMD-SVR and EEMD-LSTM are obtained by summing the prediction results of each component. Finally, BMA is used to combine the prediction results of the EEMD-ARIMA, EEMA-SVR and EEMD-LSTM models, whose weights are calculated by birth-death Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The results show that the proposed EEMD-BMA model provides more accurate precipitation predictions than the individual models; the RMSE is 17.2811 mm, the MAE is 12.6999 mm and the R2 is 0.9573. Moreover, the coverage probability (CP) and mean width (MW) of the 90% confidence interval for the predicted values of the EEMD-BMA model are 0.9375 and 60.315 mm, respectively.

One way to approximate the original variables is by using the principal component analysis (PCA) method, which uses all of the original variables to obtain a smaller set of PCs.

This method does not fit a parametric probability density function (PDF) like in ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) but provides an estimation of desired quantiles. This is a nonparametric approach that eliminates any assumption on the variable subject to calibration. This method can estimate quantiles using not only members of the ensemble but any predictor available including statistics on other variables. The method is applied to the Météo-France 35-member ensemble forecast (PEARP) for surface temperature and wind speed for available lead times from 3 up to 54 h and compared to EMOS. All postprocessed ensembles are much better calibrated than the PEARP raw ensemble and experiments on real data also show that QRF performs better than EMOS, and can bring a real gain for human forecasters compared to EMOS. QRF provides sharp and reliable probabilistic forecasts. At last, classical scoring rules to verify predictive forecasts are completed by the introduction of entropy as a general measure of reliability.},

   abstract = {Critical decisions frequently rely on high-dimensional output from complex computer simulation models that show intricate cross-variable, spatial and temporal dependence structures, with weather and climate predictions being key examples. There is a strongly increasing recognition of the need for uncertainty quantification in such settings, for which we propose and review a general multi-stage procedure called ensemble copula coupling (ECC), proceeding as follows: 1. Generate a raw ensemble, consisting of multiple runs of the computer model that differ in the inputs or model parameters in suitable ways. 2. Apply statistical postprocessing techniques, such as Bayesian model averaging or nonhomogeneous regression, to correct for systematic errors in the raw ensemble, to obtain calibrated and sharp predictive distributions for each univariate output variable individually. 3. Draw a sample from each postprocessed predictive distribution. 4. Rearrange the sampled values in the rank order structure of the raw ensemble to obtain the ECC postprocessed ensemble. The use of ensembles and statistical postprocessing have become routine in weather forecasting over the past decade. We show that seemingly unrelated, recent advances can be interpreted, fused and consolidated within the framework of ECC, the common thread being the adoption of the empirical copula of the raw ensemble. Depending on the use of Quantiles, Random draws or Transformations at the sampling stage, we distinguish the ECC-Q, ECC-R and ECC-T variants, respectively. We also describe relations to the Schaake shuffle and extant copula-based techniques. In a case study, the ECC approach is applied to predictions of temperature, pressure, precipitation and wind over Germany, based on the 50-member European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble ©Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013.},

   abstract = {Ensemble weather predictions require statistical postprocessing of systematic errors to obtain reliable and accurate probabilistic forecasts. Traditionally, this is accomplished with distributional regression models in which the parameters of a predictive distribution are estimated from a training period. We propose a flexible alternative based on neural networks that can incorporate nonlinear relationships between arbitrary predictor variables and forecast distribution parameters that are automatically learned in a data-driven way rather than requiring prespecified link functions. In a case study of 2-m temperature forecasts at surface stations in Germany, the neural network approach significantly outperforms benchmark postprocessing methods while being computationally more affordable. Key components to this improvement are the use of auxiliary pre-dictor variables and station-specific information with the help of embeddings. Furthermore, the trained neural network can be used to gain insight into the importance of meteorological variables, thereby challenging the notion of neural networks as uninterpretable black boxes. Our approach can easily be extended to other statistical postprocessing and forecasting problems. We anticipate that recent advances in deep learning combined with the ever-increasing amounts of model and observation data will transform the postprocessing of numerical weather forecasts in the coming decade.},

Particular emphasis is put on recent techniques used for correcting ensemble forecasts (member-by-member approaches), which are then applied in the context of a benchmark model, a low-order coupled ocean-atmosphere model, and in the context of an operational forecasting system. It turns out that the underlying hypothesis on the nature of the “weather noise” is crucial in order to get reliable ensemble forecasts.

   abstract = {The performance of glaciohydrological models which simulate catchment response to climate variability depends to a large degree on the data used to force the models. The forcing data become increasingly important in high-elevation, glacierized catchments where the interplay between extreme topography, climate, and the cryosphere is complex. It is challenging to generate a reliable forcing data set that captures this spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we analyze the results of a 1 year field campaign focusing on air temperature and precipitation observations in the Langtang valley in the Nepalese Himalayas. We use the observed time series to characterize both temperature lapse rates (LRs) and precipitation gradients (PGs). We study their spatial and temporal variability, and we attempt to identify possible controlling factors. We show that very clear LRs exist in the valley and that there are strong seasonal differences related to the water vapor content in the atmosphere. Results also show that the LRs are generally shallower than the commonly used environmental lapse rates. The analysis of the precipitation observations reveals that there is great variability in precipitation over short horizontal distances. A uniform valley wide PG cannot be established, and several scale-dependent mechanisms may explain our observations. We complete our analysis by showing the impact of the observed LRs and PGs on the outputs of the TOPKAPI-ETH glaciohydrological model. We conclude that LRs and PGs have a very large impact on the water balance composition and that short-term monitoring campaigns have the potential to improve model quality considerably.

As deep learning-based fusion algorithms show great potential in generating high-quality images, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely a deep progressive spatiotemporal fusion network (DPSTFN), which is coupled with pansharpening and super-resolution learning processes to satisfy requirements of STIF based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data. First, a pansharpening process is adopted to make full use of two MODIS bands with 250 m spatial resolution. Second, a super-resolution process enhances the spatial information that existed in coarse-resolution images to alleviate the enormous spatial resolution gap between MODIS and Landsat images. Third, combining the aforementioned two auxiliary processes, a progressive spatiotemporal fusion framework is proposed to generate deliberate and robust fusion results. Experiments are conducted using two MODIS-Landsat datasets of distinctive landforms to evaluate the performance of DPSTFN. The results of the subjective and objective evaluation show that our proposed network performs better than the state-of-the-art traditional STIF algorithms Fit-FC and RASTFM, and the deep learning-based algorithms EDCSTFN and StfNet.},

Plots were sampled every 200 m from the peak of Mount Mahoma at 4,200 m a.s.l. south to the Chicamocha River canyon at 1,200 m a.s.l. Diversity and cover are analyzed in each plot from soil, rock and bark substrates. We found 80 species distributed in 29 families, with Pottiaceae and Brachytheciaceae the most diverse families. Ours results show a tendency of the diversity and the coverage to increase with altitude, and we observed five altitudinal belts with three populations defined by mosses species.

Given that 70% of the country's electricity supply is provided by hydroelectric dams located in different regions and operated by different companies linked by a nationally integrated system, the decisions taken by operators in response to ENSO can be just as varied. The present study investigates the spatial and temporal distribution of the ENSO effects in four case studies, its relation to hydropower generation and prices, and assesses the reliability of global ENSO indices for monitoring and anticipating local effects. The results show ENSO-driven variations in streamflow and precipitation in all cases, but their intensity and duration are highly dependent on location. La Niña led to positive precipitation and stream flow anomalies, while El Niño led to negative anomalies. In two dams, Hidrosogamoso and Betania, the ENSO influence is stronger, and has a higher correlation with reservoir operations with lags greater than one month. Urra has more stationary annual operations given the reduced ENSO effects in the reservoir’s basin. On the whole, ENSO indices are insufficient in describing the local variations completely. And operator’s size, market share, and installed capacity contribute to increasing flexibility in operations while facing ENSO challenges.},

   abstract = { Hierarchical organization of brain function has been an established concept in the neuroscience field for a long time, however, it has been rarely demonstrated how such hierarchical macroscale functional networks are actually organized in the human brain. In this study, to answer this question, we propose a novel methodology to provide an evidence of hierarchical organization of functional brain networks. This article introduces the hybrid spatiotemporal deep learning (HSDL), by jointly using deep belief networks (DBNs) and deep least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to reveal the temporal hierarchical features and spatial hierarchical maps of brain networks based on the Human Connectome Project 900 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets. Briefly, the key idea of HSDL is to extract the weights between two adjacent layers of DBNs, which are then treated as the hierarchical dictionaries for deep LASSO to identify the corresponding hierarchical spatial maps. Our results demonstrate that both spatial and temporal aspects of dozens of functional networks exhibit multiscale properties that can be well characterized and interpreted based on existing computational tools and neuroscience knowledge. Our proposed novel hybrid deep model is used to provide the first insightful opportunity to reveal the potential hierarchical organization of time series and functional brain networks, using task-based fMRI signals of human brain. },

Longer-lead forecasts in semiarid watersheds are difficult to make due to short-term extremes and data scarcity. The current research is a new application of classification and regression trees (CART) model, which is rule-based algorithm, for prediction of the precipitation over a highly complex semiarid climate system using climate signals. We also aimed to compare the accuracy of the CART model with two most commonly applied models including time series modeling (ARIMA), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for prediction of the precipitation. Various combinations of large-scale climate signals were considered as inputs. The results indicated that the CART model had a better results (with Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE > 0.75) compared to the ANFIS and ARIMA in forecasting precipitation. Also, the results demonstrated that the ANFIS method can predict the precipitation values more accurately than the time series model based on various performance criteria. Further, fall forecasts ranked “very good” for the CART method, while the ANFIS and the time series model approximately indicated “satisfactory” and “unsatisfactory” performances for all stations, respectively. The forecasts from the CART approach can be helpful and critical for decision makers when precipitation forecast heralds a prolonged drought or flash flood.},

Accurate rainfall prediction is now more difficult than before due to the extreme climate variations. Machine learning techniques can predict rainfall by extracting hidden patterns from historical weather data. Selection of an appropriate classification technique for prediction is a difficult job. This research proposes a novel real‐time rainfall prediction system for smart cities using a machine learning fusion technique. The proposed framework uses four widely used supervised machine learning tech-niques, i.e., decision tree, Naïve Bayes, K‐nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. For effective prediction of rainfall, the technique of fuzzy logic is incorporated in the framework to inte-grate the predictive accuracies of the machine learning techniques, also known as fusion. For pre-diction, 12 years of historical weather data (2005 to 2017) for the city of Lahore is considered. Pre-processing tasks such as cleaning and normalization were performed on the dataset before the classification process. The results reflect that the proposed machine learning fusion‐based framework outperforms other models.},

Resilient methods for validation are included based on Gauss-Markov diagnostic problems and influence points, leverage, and outliers in the form of the trimmed least squares boot method and principal component analysis. To more accurately represent how CHIRPS performs at estimating precipitation at different time scales, a comparison is made using 12 specific rain gauge stations located in different subregions of Antioquia which had well differentiated climate characteristics. The results show that in some areas there is a significant difference between rain gauge data and CHIRPS data, while in other regions the behavior is very similar. CHIRPS performs well in most weather conditions in Antioquia, even in the most intense periods of the ENSO. However, it does better in the Andean subregions and underperforms in warmer regions. Furthermore, CHIRPS performs better in the driest season than in the rainiest season. This study finds that CHIRPS is a valuable source of daily rainfall data, providing good spatio-temporal coverage, and is especially suitable for areas with limited rainfall gauges.},

We addressed the performance, accuracy, and ability of TerraClimate and CHIRPSv.2 to represent 36 years of rainfall (1985-2020) from 23 stations in the Upper Chicamocha River, a Colombian basin of complex terrain and tropical hydrometeorology. Using several statistical metrics at monthly, seasonal and annual scales, we found how both datasets overestimate rainfall as a function of elevation, with better performance and accuracy from CHIRPS (r ∼0.76, R2 ∼ 0.58, NSE ∼0.56, and low RMSE ∼33.7 mm/month, MAE ∼25.2 mm/month, ME ∼6.4 mm/month, and PBIAS ∼9.3), while TerraClimate overestimates inter-annual variability, especially between June and August. Seasonally, the datasets exhibit different spatial patterns and magnitudes, even after bias correction. The findings highlight the potential use and challenges of high-resolution datasets in basins with similar topography and hydrometeorology in the Andean region.},

   abstract = {Rainfall depth is a crucial parameter in water resources and hydrological studies. Rain gauges provide the most reliable point-based rainfall estimates. However, they do not have a proper density/distribution to provide sufficient rainfall measurements in many areas, especially in arid regions. To evaluate the adequacy of satellite datasets as an alternative to the rain gauges, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is selected for the current study as a representative of the arid regions. KSA occupies most of the Arabian Peninsula and is characterized by high variability in topographic and climatic conditions. Five satellite precipitation datasets (SPDSs)—CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, CHIRPS V2.0, TMPA 3B42 V7, and GPM IMERG V6—are evaluated versus 324 conventional rain-gauges’ daily precipitation measures. The evaluation is conducted based on nine quantitative and categorical metrics. The evaluation analysis is carried out for daily, monthly, yearly, and maximum yearly records. The daily analysis revealed a low correlation for all SPDSs (<0.31), slightly improved in the yearly and maximum yearly analysis and reached its highest value (0.58) in the monthly analysis. The GPM IMERG V6 and PERSIANN-CDR have the highest probability of detection (0.55) but with a high false alarm ratio (>0.8). Accordingly, in arid regions, the use of daily SPDSs in rainfall estimation will lead to high uncertainty in the obtained results. The best performance for all statistical metrics was found at 500–750 m altitudes in the central and northern parts of the study area for all satellites except minor anomalies. CMORPH dataset has the lowest centered root mean square error (RMSEc) for all analysis periods with the best results in the monthly analyses.},

Accurate precipitation predictions remain elusive, necessitating tools for detailed spatiotemporal analysis to better understand climate impacts on the environment, agriculture, and society. This study compared three learning models, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), random forest regression (RF-R), and the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN), using monthly precipitation data (in millimeters) from 757 locations in Boyacá, Colombia. The inputs for these models were based on satellite images obtained from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data. The LSTM-NN model outperformed others, precisely replicating precipitation observations in both training and testing datasets, significantly reducing the root mean square error (RMSE), with average monthly deviations of approximately 19 mm per location. Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R2, MSE) underscored the LSTM model’s robustness and accuracy in capturing precipitation patterns. Consequently, the LSTM model was chosen to predict precipitation over a 16-month period starting from August 2023, offering a reliable tool for future meteorological forecasting and planning in the region.},

In this study, we evaluated the quality of precipitation estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks–Climate Data Record (PERSIANN<CDR) in the Upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) for the period 2000–20. The reliability of daily precipitation data from these products was tested against ground<based observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using two continuous and four categorical statistical evaluation metrics. We investigated the effects of topographical conditions on the quality of precipitation estimates. Results show that all three products have 3–4 mm day21 differences in daily precipitation rates compared to ground observations. In addition, the difference in monthly precipitation rates was more promi-nent in the wet season (November–April) than in the dry season (May–October). The margin of errors varied with the type of RS system and by location. A categorical evaluation suggests a moderate ability to detect precipitation occurrence with 50%–60% detection ability. The reliability of precipitation estimates is mainly limited by elevation and different ecoregions and climate features.},

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and de-coder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},

The proposed model introduces Bayesian inference into a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to quantify the uncertainty of streamflow prediction, and uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to analyze the importance of hydrometeorological indices on streamflow prediction. The EB-GRU is examined by forecasting the multi-step streamflow at Hukou and Qilishan stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, and compared with the Transformer (TSF), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM). New hydrological insights for the region: The comparative results show that the performance of the proposed EB-GRU surpasses that of the TSF, except for the streamflow forecast at the Hukou station with a 1-day lead time. The EB-GRU outperforms the MLP and SVM at each lead time, particularly at shorter lead times, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing short-term streamflow dynamics. The analysis of uncertainty quantization shows that noise in the input data is the primary source of overall uncertainty in model prediction, whereas a notable increase is observed in the uncertainty caused by the model in the flood season. Furthermore, the application of the SHAP method reveals the critical role of water level in streamflow prediction.},

To minimize it’s effects in these regimes, a powerful class of machine learning algorithms called long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) models, which have become popular in time series forecasting, because they are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problems is applied. LSTM and GRU models have also demonstrated their capacity in sequence modelling, speech recognition and streamflow forecasting. In this paper we proposed a hybrid model for streamflow forecasting using 35 consecutive years Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) data set of ten basins having different basin characteristics from different climatic regions in United States. The proposed hybrid model’s performance is compared to the conventional LSTM and GRU models. Our experiments on the 10 MOPEX’s river basins demonstrate that, although the proposed hybrid model outperforms conventional LSTM with respect to streamflow forecasting, but the performance is almost same with GRU and is therefore highly recommended as an efficient and reliable approach in hydrological fields.},

Statistical models such as linear inverse model (LIM), analog forecasting (AF), and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been widely used for ENSO prediction, offering flexibility and relatively low computational expense compared to large dynamic models. However, these models have limitations in capturing spatial patterns in SST variability or relying on linear dynamics. Here we present a modified Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) network for the ENSO region spatio-temporal sequence prediction problem, along with the Ni\~no 3.4 index prediction as a down stream task. The proposed ConvGRU network, with an encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence structure, takes historical SST maps of the Pacific region as input and generates future SST maps for subsequent months within the ENSO region. To evaluate the performance of the ConvGRU network, we trained and tested it using data from multiple large climate models. The results demonstrate that the ConvGRU network significantly improves the predictability of the Ni\~no 3.4 index compared to LIM, AF, and RNN. This improvement is evidenced by extended useful prediction range, higher Pearson correlation, and lower root-mean-square error. The proposed model holds promise for improving our understanding and predicting capabilities of the ENSO phenomenon and can be broadly applicable to other weather and climate prediction scenarios with spatial patterns and teleconnections.},

During the recent past two decades, both mean and gust wind magnitude and frequency (exceeding the 90th percentile) underwent nonlinear changes, driven by the dominant winter variability. In particular, consistent with previous studies, the significant ( <italic>p</italic>  &lt; .05) stilling ceased in 2003, followed by no clear trend afterwards. The detected stilling‐reversal is linked to large‐scale atmospheric circulation changes, in particular to the North Atlantic Oscillation for both mean and gust wind changes, and the intensity changes of extratropical cyclones passing across Sweden especially for wind gusts. Furthermore, in different wind change phases, the observed wind distribution did not vary uniformly for the various wind speed ranges; instead, strong winds drove most of the changes. In the same way, increases in gust winds are greater compared to changes in mean wind speed conditions. The stilling‐reversal is also identified by the ERA5 reanalysis, where large‐scale atmospheric circulation changes are captured. But the background slowdown detected in most stations does not appear in the ERA5 data as the observed increase in forest cover is not considered in the reanalysis. This study reveals that, in addition to the large‐scale interannual variability, changes in surface roughness (e.g., changes in forest cover) contribute to the observed wind variability across Sweden. </p>},

Hydrological time series data consists of nonlinear features and various time scales. With this view in mind, this study has combined the strengths of the Wavelet transformation, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to test a new method of a hybrid model for their ability to accurately predict future droughts. A 30-year rainfall data from the year 1986 to 2016 for Malaysia’s Langat River Basin was analyzed. Meteorological drought indices (DI) such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standard Index of Annual Precipitation (SIAP) were used to compute historical drought events. At first, each of these computed drought time series went through a process of decomposition to be divided as low frequency and high-frequency sub-series by discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Secondly, the high and low-frequency sub-series were passed through the predictive model of ANN and ARIMA techniques, respectively. Lastly, the predicted sub-series were used to reconstruct and develop a final drought prediction model. It was found that the Wavelet-ARIMA-ANN (which named as W-2A) model outperformed the single ANN and wavelet-ANN predictive models. The ANN model developed by SPI achieved an overall correlation co-efficient R-value of 0.423, but the wavelet-based ANN model decreased in the R-value to 0.415. Finally, two different models, which were established using drought indices SPI and SIAP, and discrete wavelet transformation-based hybrid ANN-ARIMA (W-2A), have achieved improved R values of 0.914 and 0.934 respectively.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to detect trends in mean flow and total precipitation data over southern parts of Quebec and Ontario, Canada. The main purpose of the trend assessment is to find out what time scales are affecting the trends observed in the datasets used. In this study, a new trend detection method for hydrological studies is explored, which involves the use of wavelet transforms (WTs) in order to separate the rapidly and slowly changing events contained in a time series. More specifically, this study co-utilizes the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique and the Mann–Kendall (MK) trend tests to analyze and detect trends in monthly, seasonally-based, and annual data from eight flow stations and seven meteorological stations in southern Ontario and Quebec during 1954–2008. The combination of the DWT and MK test in analyzing trends has not been extensively explored to date, especially in detecting trends in Canadian flow and precipitation time series. The mother wavelet type and the extension border used in the wavelet transform, as well as the number of decomposition levels, were determined based on two criteria. The first criterion is the mean relative error of the wavelet approximation series and the original time series. In addition, a new criterion is proposed and explored in this study, which is based on the relative error of the MK Z-values of the approximation component and the original time series. Sequential Mann–Kendall analysis on the different wavelet detail components (with their approximation component added) that result from the time series decomposition was also used and found to be helpful because it depicts how harmonious each of the detail components (plus approximation) is with respect to the original data. This study found that most of the trends are positive and started during the mid-1960s to early 1970s. The results from the wavelet analysis and Mann–Kendall tests on the different data types (using the 5% significance level) reveal that in general, intra- and inter-annual events (up to 4 years) are more influential in affecting the observed trends.},

   abstract = {Geometry is based on vision. Hence, the visual information processing of the nervous system regulates the structure of geometry. In this paper, we shall construct geometry following the process of visual information processing in the nervous system. Firstly, photons are captured by photoreceptor cells in the retina. At this stage, the retinal bitmap image is constructed using photo- receptor cells as pixels. The retinal bitmap is the foundation of quantitative properties of images throughout the visual processing. Secondly, the edge of the object is extracted in the primary visual cortex. When a three-dimensional object is projected in two dimensions, the edge of the object is ideally a line without width. While Euclid defined the line as the length without width. Surprisingly, a type of cells in the primary visual cortex react the Euclidean line. At this stage, Euclidean geometry without curves is constructed. Thirdly, curves are recognized in the visual area V4. At this stage, Euclidean geometry with curves is constructed. The next problem is the compatibility of these stages. The problem of the compatibility between the first and second stages is that there are irrational lengths in Euclidean geometry. Ancient Greeks used the double contradiction to solve the compatibility problem. An irra- tional number is defined as a number that divides rational numbers into larger and smaller rational numbers. The double contradiction is a method of defining non-rational numbers using rational numbers. Also, double contra- diction is used to solve the compatibility problem between the second and third stages. Even though the length of the curve is not defined in Elements, the length of a curve can be defined by the length of straight lines. Similarly, properties of curves are defined by straight lines. In differentiation, the slope of the curve is defined by the slope of the line. In integration, the area under the curve is defined by the total area of thin rectangles. Finally, as a logical basis for calculus, the double contradiction should be rethought.},

   abstract = {Variations in monthly precipitation are associated with climate extremes having significant socio-economic and eco-environmental impacts. Knowledge of monthly precipitation information is therefore valuable for policy making. Extensive research has been conducted on dynamic prediction using state-of-the-art coupled climate models. However, the skilful prediction of monthly precipitation with dynamical models remains a challenge. With the development of machine learning tools, statistical predictions show comparable performance with dynamic models, but they are limited to at-site monthly prediction, due to the lack of ability for processing spatially connected geophysical data. To improve monthly precipitation forecasting and provide regional forecasts, we propose a model termed UNet-RegPre based on convolutional neural network and U-net architecture. The model shows comparable prediction skills with recurrent state-of-the-art dynamic forecasts (CFSv2), and has the capability to capture spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and reproduce the main process of representative droughts. The key precursors for rainfall development identified by UNet-RegPre shows that the constructed model can detect the climatic connection between rainfall in eastern China and summer monsoon, showing the potential to advance hydrometeorological understanding with a deep learning-based model. These results suggest that the proposed model can be a potential tool for precipitation prediction.},

   abstract = {Terrestrial water storage (TWS) includes all forms of water stored on and below the land surface, and is a key determinant of global water and energy budgets. However, TWS data from measurements by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission are only available from 2002, limiting global and regional understanding of the long-term trends and variabilities in the terrestrial water cycle under climate change. This study presents long-term (i.e., 1940–2022) and relatively high-resolution (i.e., 0.25◦) monthly time series of TWS anomalies over the global land surface. The reconstruction is achieved by using a set of machine learning models with a large number of predictors, including climatic and hydrological variables, land use/land cover data, and vegetation indicators (e.g., leaf area index). The outcome, machine-learning-reconstructed TWS estimates (i.e., GTWS-MLrec), fits well with the GRACE/GRACE-FO measurements, showing high correlation coefficients and low biases in the GRACE era. We also evaluate GTWS-MLrec with other independent products such as the land–ocean mass budget, atmospheric and terrestrial water budget in 341 large river basins, and streamflow measurements at 10 168 gauges. The results show that our proposed GTWS-MLrec performs overall as well as, or is more reliable than, previous TWS datasets. Moreover, our reconstructions successfully reproduce the consequences of climate variability such as strong El Niño events. The GTWS-MLrec dataset consists of three reconstructions based on (a) mascons of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA; (b) three detrended and de-seasonalized reconstructions; and (c) six global average TWS series over land areas, both with and without Greenland and Antarctica. Along with its extensive attributes, GTWS_MLrec can support a wide range of geoscience applications such as better understanding the global water budget, constraining and evaluating hydrological models, climate-carbon coupling, and water resources management. GTWS-MLrec is available on Zenodo through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10040927 (Yin, 2023).},

   abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of the behaviours of the various geophysical processes and an effective evaluation of time series (else referred to as “stochastic”) simulation models require, among others, detailed investigations across temporal scales. In this work, we propose a novel and detailed methodological framework for advancing and enriching such investigations in a hydroclimatic context. This specific framework is primarily based on a new feature compilation for multi-scale hydroclimatic analyses, and can facilitate largely interpretable feature investigations and comparisons in terms of temporal dependence, temporal variation, “forecastability”, lumpiness, stability, nonlinearity (and linearity), trends, spikiness, curvature and seasonality. Multifaceted characterizations are herein obtained by computing the values of the proposed feature compilation across nine temporal resolutions (i.e., the 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 7-day, 0.5-month, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month and 6-month ones) and three hydroclimatic time series types (i.e., temperature, precipitation and streamflow) for 34-year-long time series records originating from 511 geographical locations across the contiguous United States. Based on the acquired information and knowledge, similarities and differences between the examined time series types with respect to the evolution patterns characterizing their feature values with increasing (or decreasing) temporal resolution are identified. Moreover, the computed features are used as inputs to unsupervised random forests for detecting any meaningful clusters between the examined hydroclimatic time series. This clustering plays an illustrative role within this research, as it facilitates the identification of spatial patterns (with them consisting an important scientific target in hydroclimatic research) and their cross-scale comparison. We find that these specific patterns are largely analogous across temporal resolutions for the examined continental-scale region. We also apply explainable machine learning to compare the features with respect to their usefulness in clustering the time series at the various temporal resolutions. These latter investigations play a vital role within the proposed methodological framework, as they allow interpretation of hydroclimatic similarity at the various temporal resolutions. For most of the features, this usefulness can vary to a notable degree across temporal resolutions and time series types, thereby implying the need for conducting multifaceted time series characterizations for the study of hydroclimatic similarity.},

   abstract = {Temporal disaggregation of rainfall has been of particular focus because of the non-availability of higher-resolution rainfall data for a long-duration period. Fine temporal resolution rainfall is used in a multitude of hydrological applications. Researchers have proposed various disaggregation models to disaggregate coarse temporal resolution rainfall. In this paper, firstly, the microcanonical multiplicative random cascade (MMRC) model is applied for disaggregation from daily rainfall to a one-hour scale. The model is applied in four different rainfall stations for disaggregation having varying rainfall patterns and characteristics. It is observed that the MMRC model can generate statistically reliable rainfall time series; however, the extreme rainfall characteristics are not well conserved by the model for all the stations. This paper describes a new model based on a random multiplicative cascade process where classification and parameter generation is done by k-means clustering such that it can better conserve extreme rainfall conditions and generate a reliable rainfall time series (MMRC-K). K-means clustering is a vector quantization method that divides the observations into a particular number of clusters based on the nearest mean called cluster centroid. The novel approach is tested with the same four Indian cities. The use of k-means clustering has made the classification and parameter generation of the model robust such that it can work with data sets of varying characteristics. It is found that MMRC-K provides improved conservation of extreme rainfall characteristics compared to the MMRC model for all four stations. The MMRC-K model reproduces the IDF curves of Delhi and Mumbai stations quite well; however, a little discrepancy was observed at higher resolution and larger return periods in Kolkata and Chennai stations. Extreme rainfall at finer resolution is used in various hydrological analyses and design problems like urban drainage design, stormwater management, etc. The overall superior conservation of the extreme rainfall characteristics in the model-generated rainfall time series by the MMRC-K model compared to the MMRC model supports the potential applicability of the model for temporal disaggregation.},

This paper proposes to develop a novel graph convolutional recurrent neural network (GCRNN) to predict time series of water demand related to some water supply systems or district metering areas that belong to the same geographical area. The aim is to build a graph-based model able to capture the dependence among the different water demand time series both in spatial and in temporal terms. This model is built on a set of different graphs, and its performance is compared to two methods, including a state-of-the-art deep long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and a traditional seasonal autoregressive moving average model. Additionally, the forecasting model is tested in a condition when a sensor has a malfunction. The results show the ability of the GCRNN to produce accurate and reliable forecasting, especially when based on graph built while accounting for both time-series correlation and spatial criteria. The GCRNN consistently outperforms the LSTM during the fault test, showing its ability to generate a robust prediction for days after a sensor malfunction, given the GCRNN's ability to benefit from the other time series of the graph.},

   abstract = {Hydrologic signatures are quantitative metrics that describe a streamflow time series. Examples include annual maximum flow, baseflow index and recession shape descriptors. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to learn encodings that are optimal ML equivalents of hydrologic signatures, and that are derived directly from the data. We compare the learned signatures to classical signatures, interpret their meaning, and use them to build rainfall-runoff models in otherwise ungauged watersheds. Our model has an encoder–decoder structure. The encoder is a convolutional neural net mapping historical flow and climate data to a low-dimensional vector encoding, analogous to hydrological signatures. The decoder structure includes stores and fluxes similar to a classical hydrologic model. For each timestep, the decoder uses current climate data, watershed attributes and the encoding to predict coefficients that distribute precipitation between stores and store outflow coefficients. The model is trained end-to-end on the U.S. CAMELS watershed data set to minimize streamflow error. We show that learned signatures can extract new information from streamflow series, because using learned signatures as input to the process-informed model improves prediction accuracy over benchmark configurations that use classical signatures or no signatures. We interpret learned signatures by correlation with classical signatures, and by using sensitivity analysis to assess their impact on modeled store dynamics. Learned signatures are spatially correlated and relate to streamflow dynamics including seasonality, high and low extremes, baseflow and recessions. We conclude that process-informed ML models and other applications using hydrologic signatures may benefit from replacing expert-selected signatures with learned signatures.},

Deep learning models can capture complex relationships due to their ability to learn non-linear patterns. This study evaluates the performance of the Transformer in forecasting spring discharges for up to 4 days. We compare it to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network and a common baseline model on a well-studied Austrian karst spring (LKAS2) with an extensive hourly database. We evaluated the models for two further karst springs with diverse discharge characteristics for comparing the performances based on four metrics. In the discharge-based scenario, the Transformer performed significantly better than the LSTM for the spring with the longest response times (9% mean difference across metrics), while it performed poorer for the spring with the shortest response time (4% difference). Moreover, the Transformer better predicted the shape of the discharge during snowmelt. Both models performed well across all lead times and springs with 0.64–0.92 for the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 10.8%–28.7% for the symmetric mean absolute percentage error for the LKAS2 spring. The temporal information, rainfall and electrical conductivity were the controlling input variables for the non-discharge based scenario. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the prediction intervals are smallest in winter and autumn and highest during snowmelt. Our results thus suggest that the Transformer is a promising model to support the drinking water abstraction management, and can have advantages due to its attention mechanism particularly for longer response times.},

However, it is difficult for a standalone method to track the complex hydrological time series with highly nonlinear and nonstationary features. To improve the forecasting accuracy, this study proposes a hybrid model using compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and twin support vector machine (TSVM) optimized by metaheuristic algorithm. Firstly, the CEEMDAN tool is chosen to divide the original runoff data into several relatively stable subcomponents with various resolutions and frequencies. Then, the TSVM forecasting model is established to extract the deep features of each subseries, while the emerging cooperation search algorithm is used to search for satisfying parameter combination. The final forecasting value for the original hydrological time series is formulated by aggregating the outputs of all TSVM models. Long-term streamflow data from several hydrological stations in China's Yangtze River is used for simulation. Experimental results reveal that the hybrid model significantly outperforms several conventional forecasting models in prediction accuracy. For instance, the proposed method improves the root mean squared error and mean absolute error value with about 36.5% and 41.6% reductions compared with the traditional support vector machine at station B. Thus, a novel and effective evolutionary artificial intelligence model is developed for hydrological forecasting.},

The recognition of key factors plays a vital role and thus affects the performance of the model. However, there is no conclusion on which recognition algorithm is the most suitable. To address this issue, an LSTM model combined with two attention mechanisms both in the input and hidden layers, namely AT-LSTM, is proposed for long-term runoff forecasting at Yichang and Pingshan stations in China. The added attention mechanisms automatically assign weights to 130 climate phenomenon indexes, avoiding the use of subjectively set recognition algorithms. Results show that the AT-LSTM model outperforms the Pearson’s correlation based LSTM model in terms of four evaluation metrics for monthly runoff forecasting. Further, the set indirect runoff prediction method verifies that the AT-LSTM model also performs effectively in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration forecasting, and the indirect runoff prediction is inferior to the AT-LSTM model to establish a direct link between climate factors and runoff. Finally, four key factors related to runoff are identified by the attention mechanism and their impacts on runoff are analyzed on intra- and inter-annual scales. The proposed AT-LSTM model can effectively improve the accuracy of long-term forecasting and identify the dynamic influence of input factors.},

Statistical models such as linear inverse model (LIM), analog forecasting (AF), and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been widely used for ENSO prediction, offering flexibility and relatively low computational expense compared to large dynamic models. However, these models have limitations in capturing spatial patterns in SST variability or relying on linear dynamics. Here we present a modified Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) network for the ENSO region spatio-temporal sequence prediction problem, along with the Niño 3.4 index prediction as a down stream task. The proposed ConvGRU network, with an encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence structure, takes historical SST maps of the Pacific region as input and generates future SST maps for subsequent months within the ENSO region. To evaluate the performance of the ConvGRU network, we trained and tested it using data from multiple large climate models. The results demonstrate that the ConvGRU network significantly improves the predictability of the Niño 3.4 index compared to LIM, AF, and RNN. This improvement is evidenced by extended useful prediction range, higher Pearson correlation, and lower root-mean-square error. The proposed model holds promise for improving our understanding and predicting capabilities of the ENSO phenomenon and can be broadly applicable to other weather and climate prediction scenarios with spatial patterns and teleconnections.},

   abstract = {Precipitation is the most important driver of the hydrological cycle, but it is challenging to estimate it over large scales from satellites and models. Here, we assessed the performance of six global and quasi-global high-resolution precipitation datasets (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5), Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations version 2.0 (CHIRPS), Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation version 2.80 (MSWEP), TerraClimate (TERRA), Climate Prediction Centre Unified version 1.0 (CPCU), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CCS-CDR, hereafter PERCCDR) for hydrological modelling globally and quasi-globally. We forced the WBMsed global hydrological model with the precipitation datasets to simulate river discharge from 1983 to 2019 and evaluated the predicted discharge against 1825 hydrological stations worldwide, using a range of statistical methods. The results show large differences in the accuracy of discharge predictions when using different precipitation input datasets. Based on evaluation at annual, monthly, and daily timescales, MSWEP followed by ERA5 demonstrated a higher correlation (CC) and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) than other datasets for more than 50 % of the stations, whilst ERA5 was the second-highest-performing dataset, and it showed the highest error and bias for about 20 % of the stations. PERCCDR is the least-well-performing dataset, with a bias of up to 99 % and a normalised root mean square error of up to 247 %. PERCCDR only show a higher KGE and CC than the other products for less than 10 % of the stations. Even though MSWEP provided the highest performance overall, our analysis reveals high spatial variability, meaning that it is important to consider other datasets in areas where MSWEP showed a lower performance. The results of this study provide guidance on the selection of precipitation datasets for modelling river discharge for a basin, region, or climatic zone as there is no single best precipitation dataset globally. Finally, the large discrepancy in the performance of the datasets in different parts of the world highlights the need to improve global precipitation data products.},

   abstract = {Climate change has exacerbated water stress and water-related disasters, necessitating more precise streamflow simulations. However, in the majority of global regions, a deficiency of streamflow data constitutes a significant constraint on modeling endeavors. Traditional distributed hydrological models and regionalization approaches have shown suboptimal performance. While current deep learning (DL)-related models trained on large data sets excel in spatial generalization, the direct applicability of these models in certain regions with unique hydrological processes can be challenging due to the limited representativeness within the training data set. Furthermore, transfer learning DL models pre-trained on large data sets still necessitate local data for retraining, thereby constraining their applicability. To address these challenges, we present a physics-informed DL model based on a distributed framework. It involves spatial discretization and the establishment of differentiable hydrological models for discrete sub-basins, coupled with a differentiable Muskingum method for channel routing. By introducing upstream-downstream relationships, model errors in sub-basins propagate through the river network to the watershed outlet, enabling the optimization using limited downstream streamflow data, thereby achieving spatial simulation of ungauged internal sub-basins. The model, when trained solely on the downstream-most station, outperforms the distributed hydrological model in streamflow simulation at both the training station and upstream held-out stations. Additionally, in comparison to transfer learning models, our model requires fewer gauge stations for training, but achieves higher precision in simulating streamflow on spatially held-out stations, indicating better spatial generalization ability. Consequently, this model offers a novel approach to hydrological simulation in data-scarce regions, especially those with poor hydrological representativeness.},

   abstract = {Due to the rapidly changing climate conditions, precipitation nowcasting poses a daunting challenge because it is impossible to make accurate short-term forecasts due to the rapid fluctuations in weather conditions. There are limitations to traditional methods of forecasting precipitation, such as the use of numerical models and radar extrapolation, when it comes to providing highly detailed and timely forecasts. With the help of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, including deep neural networks, transformers and generative models, complex precipitation nowcasting tasks can be performed in an efficient way. To address this critical task and enhance proactive emergency disaster management, we propose an innovative method based on transformer-based generative models for precipitation nowcasting. Our study area is the Soyang Dam basin in South Korea, located upstream of the Han River, characterized by a monsoon climate with approximately 1200 mm of annual precipitation. To develop a precipitation nowcasting model, radar composite data from 10 weather radars across South Korea is used. By utilizing radar reflective data in order to train our model, we are able to effectively predict future precipitation patterns, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic weather conditions caused by heavy rainfalls. This dataset covers reflectivity data from 2018 to 2022, with a spatial resolution of 1km over a 960 × 1200 grid. Normalization using the min–max scaler method is applied to this reflectivity data, which is then transformed into grayscale images for uniform comparison. We enhance performance effectively by employing transfer learning with pre-trained Transformer models. Initially, we train the model using a comprehensive dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tune it for precipitation nowcasting using radar reflective data. This adaptation improves the accuracy of rainfall forecasting by capturing crucial features. Leveraging prior task knowledge through transfer learning not only enhances prediction accuracy but also increases overall efficiency. In terms of predictive accuracy, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based nowcasting model outperforms related approaches, including conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), U-Net, convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), pySTEP. As a result of this research, disaster preparedness and response will be greatly improved through improved weather prediction.},

   abstract = {Water shortage is a major problem facing the world. Artificial precipitation enhancement is an effective way to improve precipitation conversion rate, but the selection of artificial precipitation enhancement operation timing is the main difficulty, and the precipitable water vapor(PWV) is a major index. The variation of PWV is nonlinear and unstable due to complex factors, especially in the Qilian mountains in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, so it is difficult to predict it accurately. Therefore, based on the analysis of the observed data of microwave radiometer in Qilian Mountains, a new combined model is constructed which considers both data decomposition and prediction of several single models in this research. In the data preprocessing stage, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) technique is used to decompose and de-noise the PWV sequence. In the prediction stage, four neural network with unique characteristics, back propagation neural network (BPNN), long short term memroy (LSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and temporal convolutional network (TCN), are selected to predict the decomposed data respectively. A variant of gray Wolf optimization algorithm (IGWO) is used to determine the optimal weight of the model, and finally the comprehensive predicted value is obtained by weighting calculation. Through the analysis of experimental results, in the longest 15-step prediction, compared with CEEMDAN-BP, CEEMDAN-LSTM, CEEMDAN-BiGRU, CEEMDAN-TCN, the prediction accuracy can be improved by 54.17%, 35.05%, 22.38%, 23.86%, respectively.

   abstract = {Accurate spatiotemporal prediction of the root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is essential for agricultural water management and drought early warning systems. However, current prediction methods often lack prior knowledge, which restricts their predictive accuracy. Causality is an essential form of prior knowledge, describing the relationship where one factor directly influences another, and helping to understand how specific changes lead to particular outcomes within a system. We propose a novel model named Causal-Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Causal-ConvLSTM) to predict RZSM in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) with a lead time of 1–14 days. The Causal-ConvLSTM integrates causal inference into the ConvLSTM framework by employing a causal weight unit to directly incorporate causal relationships from spatiotemporal sequences. The experimental results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal prediction accuracy of the Causal-ConvLSTM model outperforms that of the three baseline models (ConvLSTM, LSTM, and PredRNN-V2) with a lead time of 1–14 days in the YRB. Specifically, the improvements of R2 for the proposed Causal-ConvLSTM over the ConvLSTM are 10.17 %, 18.40 %, and 25.65 % at 1, 7, and 14 lead times, respectively. The ablation experiments also show an improvement in the performance of the Causal-ConvLSTM model relative to the simple feature selection model. These findings establish that incorporating causality into spatiotemporal prediction frameworks significantly enhances predictive capabilities, and future research should prioritize the improvement of model performance and interpretability through the causality.},

   abstract = {Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear spatiotemporal prediction problem. However, few studies have considered the spatial characteristics of rainfall-runoff relationship in runoff forecasts based on machine learning. With the emergence of high-resolution Satellite-based Precipitation Products (SPPs) and the continuous improvement of rainfall estimation accuracy, the shortcoming of sparse spatial information for in-situ rainfall monitoring has been made up. Therefore, this study developed a large scale spatiotemporal deep learning rainfall-runoff (SDLRR) forecasting model for hydrological stations in the upper Yangtze River, and evaluated the positive impact of utilizing spatial information of three SPPs on reducing errors of runoff forecasts. The adopted remote sensing precipitation products are bias-corrected Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement data (IMERG) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis data (TMPA). For runoff forecasting at the Luoduxi (LDX) hydrological station, compared to regular Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) model, the proposed SDLRR model that utilizing IMERG data as precipitation input (IMERG_SDLRR) improved 15% in terms of Coefficient of Determination (R2) and improved 25% in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Compared to the best performance model among models using area-averaged precipitation as input, IMERG_SDLRR improved 5% in terms of R2 and 11% in terms of RMSE. Good performance was also acquired in the other hydrological stations. For extreme flood forecasts, IMERG_SDLRR decreased Mean Relative Error (MRE) by 0.29 and increased Qualified Rate (QR) by 53% compared to LSTM, and decreased MRE by 0.08 and increased QR by 6% compared to the best performance model using area-averaged precipitation as input. The utilization of IMERG or TMPA spatial information improved the accuracy of runoff forecasting. The accuracy evaluation of SPPs based on the results of spatiotemporal rainfall-runoff forecasts method was also demonstrated. The research is of great significance for developing runoff forecasting methods and optimizing water resources management.},

   abstract = {Accurate quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is essential for various applications, including land surface modeling, flood forecasting, drought monitoring and prediction. In situ precipitation datasets, remote sensing-based estimations, and reanalysis products have heterogeneous uncertainty. Numerous models have been developed to merge precipitation estimations from different sources to improve the accuracy of QPE. However, many of these attempts are mainly focused on spatial or temporal correlations between various remote sensing sources and/or gauge data separately, and thus, the developed model cannot fully capture the inherent spatiotemporal dependencies that could potentially improve the precipitation estimations. In this study, we developed a general framework that can simultaneously merge and downscale multiple user-defined precipitation products by using rain gauge observations as target values. A novel deep learning-based convolutional neural network architecture, namely, the precipitation data fusion network (PDFN), that combines multiple layers of 3D-CNN and ConvLSTM was developed to fully exploit the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation. This architecture benefits from techniques such as batch normalization, data augmentation schemes, and dropout layers to avoid overfitting and address skewed class proportions due to the highly imbalanced nature of the precipitation datasets. The results showed that the fused daily product remarkably improved the mean square error (MSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) by 35% and 16%, respectively, compared to the best-performing product.},

   abstract = {The rivers of High-mountain Asia provide freshwater to around 1.9 billion people. However, precipitation, the main driver of river flow, is still poorly understood due to limited in situ measurements in this area. Existing tools to interpolate these measurements or downscale and bias-correct precipitation models have several limitations. To overcome these challenges, this paper uses a probabilistic machine learning approach called multi-fidelity Gaussian processes (MFGPs) to downscale the fifth ECMWF climate reanalysis (ERA5). The method is first validated by downscaling ERA5 precipitation data over data-rich Europe and then data-sparse upper Beas and Sutlej river basins in the Himalayas. We find that MFGPs are simpler to implement and more applicable to smaller datasets than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. MFGPs are also able to quantify and narrow the uncertainty associated with the precipitation estimates, which is especially needed over ungauged areas and can be used to estimate the likelihood of extreme events that lead to floods or droughts. Over the upper Beas and Sutlej river basins, the precipitation estimates from the MFGP model are similar to or more accurate than available gridded precipitation products (APHRODITE, TRMM, CRU TS, and bias-corrected WRF). The MFGP model and APHRODITE annual mean precipitation estimates generally agree with each other for this region, with the MFGP model predicting slightly higher average precipitation and variance. However, more significant spatial deviations between the MFGP model and APHRODITE over this region appear during the summer monsoon. The MFGP model also presents a more effective resolution, generating more structure at finer spatial scales than ERA5 and APHRODITE. MFGP precipitation estimates for the upper Beas and Sutlej basins between 1980 and 2012 at a 0.0625° resolution (approx. 7 km) are jointly published with this paper.},

At sub-seasonal scales, readily available hydrometeorological forecast products often exhibit large uncertainties and insufficient accuracies to support decision-making. We propose a deep-learning-based modelling framework for sub-seasonal joint precipitation and streamflow ensemble forecasts for a lead time of up to 30 d. This is achieved by coupling (1) an ensemble of enhanced convolutional neural network (CNN) models with ResNet blocks and a specialized loss function for statistically downscaling of European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble precipitation forecasts to (2) a hybrid hydrologic model integrating the conceptual Xin’anjiang model (XAJ) and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) for ensemble streamflow forecasting (XAJ-LSTM). Applying the modelling framework to the source region of the Yangtze River Basin, results indicate that the CNN-based downscaling model exhibits ∼ 34 % and ∼ 26 % less root mean squared error (RMSE) than the raw ECMWF forecasts and the quantile mapping (QM) forecasts, respectively, averaged over the 30 d lead time. Similarly, the CNN achieves approximately 6 % and 10 % lower RMSE than raw forecasts and QM for heavy precipitation events. Using these precipitation forecasts as meteorological forcing for the hybrid XAJ-LSTM hydrologic model, we found that forecasted streamflow and flood peaks driven by CNN-based precipitation forecasts have 16 %–33 % lower relative errors and 20 %–31 % lower RMSE compared to those driven by raw forecasts. However, the standalone XAJ model shows only marginal improvements with the same enhanced precipitation forecasts. This highlights the importance of understanding the effectiveness of the hydrologic model as part of the sub-seasonal hydrometeorological modelling chain. Our study is expected to provide implications for leveraging advanced AI techniques to enhance sub-seasonal hydrometeorological forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency for effective water resources management and disaster preparedness.},

Although many brilliant forecasting methods have been developed, long-term (a few days ahead) meteorological prediction still relies on traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) that is not competent for the oncoming flood of meteorological data. To improve the forecasting ability faced with meteorological big data, this article adopts the Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) technique and proposes a deep learning framework to model the dynamics of multi-modal meteorological data along spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, a convolution based network is developed to extract the spatial context of multi-modal meteorological data. Considering the complex relationship between different modalities, the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique is introduced to automate the designing procedure of the fusion network in a purely data-driven manner. As for the temporal dimension, an encoder-decoder structure is built to exhaustively model the temporal dynamics of the embedding sequence. Specializing for the numerical sequence representation transformation, the multi-head attention module endows the proposed model with the ability to forecast future data. Generally speaking, the whole framework could be optimized with the standard back-propagation, yielding an end-to-end learning mechanism. To investigate its feasibility, the proposed model is evaluated with four typical meteorological modalities including temperature, relative humidity, and two components of wind, which are all restricted under the region whose latitude and longitude range from 0° to 55° N and 70° E to 140° E, respectively. Experiments on two datasets with different resolutions verify that deep learning is effective as an operational technique for the meteorological forecasting task.},

Then at each of time scales, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model is constructed to predict the precipitation anomaly subseries by coupling with partial information (PI) algorithm for selecting the model inputs and attention mechanism (AM) for optimizing the model structure. Finally, all the predicted subseries are summed, and then the summed series is transformed as the monthly precipitation prediction.

The MLSTM is formed by coupling the LSTM with the ATWT. For comparison, the inputs of all the models are identified by the PI algorithm. Results show that the prediction of all the models is more skillful in the western region than in the eastern region of the basin, which is strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of the variability of precipitation. The LSTM outperforms the MLR in terms of two performance evaluation indicators at most of stations.

Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5–90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

Given an intermediate feature map, our module sequentially infers attention maps along two separate dimensions, channel and spatial, then the attention maps are multiplied to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement. Because CBAM is a lightweight and general module, it can be integrated into any CNN architectures seamlessly with negligible overheads and is end-to-end trainable along with base CNNs. We validate our CBAM through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, MS&nbsp;COCO detection, and VOC&nbsp;2007 detection datasets.

   abstract = {In light of recent advances in deep learning and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology, there has been a growing adoption of ship detection models that are based on deep learning methodologies. However, the efficiency of SAR ship detection models is significantly impacted by complex backgrounds, noise, and multi-scale ships (the number of pixels occupied by ships in SAR images varies significantly). To address the aforementioned issues, this research proposes a Pyramid Pooling Attention Network (PPA-Net) for SAR multi-scale ship detection. Firstly, a Pyramid Pooled Attention Module (PPAM) is designed to alleviate the influence of background noise on ship detection while its parallel component favors the processing of multiple ship sizes. Different from the previous attention module, the PPAM module can better suppress the background noise in SAR images because it considers the saliency of ships in SAR images. Secondly, an Adaptive Feature Balancing Module (AFBM) is developed, which can automatically balance the conflict between ship semantic information and location information. Finally, the detection capabilities of the ship detection model for multi-scale ships are further improved by introducing the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. This innovative module enhances the detection model’s ability to detect ships of varying scales by extracting features from multiple scales using atrous convolutions and spatial pyramid pooling. PPA-Net achieved detection accuracies of 95.19% and 89.27% on the High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset (HRSID) and the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD), respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that PPA-Net outperforms other ship detection models.},

   abstract = {Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But recent deep learning object detectors have avoided pyramid representations, in part because they are compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using FPN in a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.},

   abstract = {Effective traffic prediction is crucial for optimizing urban transportation systems, minimizing congestion, and enhancing overall efficiency. Traffic congestion results in prolonged travel durations, higher fuel consumption, economic setbacks, and increased environmental pollution. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Hybrid CNN-GRU-LSTM model—an advanced deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This integrated model is specifically designed to capture both spatial and temporal patterns of traffic flow, making it highly effective for predicting vehicle volumes at intersections. The Hybrid CNN-GRU-LSTM leverages CNN to model spatial dependencies between road segments, while GRU and LSTM layers handle short-term and long-term temporal patterns in traffic data. This combination allows for more accurate predictions by incorporating spatial relationships and temporal dynamics simultaneously. The model was tested using publicly available datasets, including PeMS, the England dataset, the P/Castellano dataset, and the Fedesoriano dataset, and results demonstrate that Hybrid CNN-GRU-LSTM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving a reduction of up to 30–35% in error values. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining CNN, GRU, and LSTM architectures for traffic prediction, offering a robust solution for transportation management. The proposed model’s significant improvement in prediction accuracy can help mitigate the adverse effects of traffic congestion and enhance the overall performance of transportation networks.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

   abstract = {Batch Normalization (BN) is a milestone technique in the development of deep learning, enabling various networks to train. However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems—BN’s error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits BN’s usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. GN’s computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN has 10.6% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code.},

   abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

   abstract = {Accurate and effective forecasting of short-term global solar radiation is critical for the development of photovoltaic systems, particularly for integration into existing grid systems. However, its non-stationary characteristics caused by climatic factors make its estimation extremely challenging. In this regard, a newly designed learning technique for multi-hour global solar radiation forecasting is proposed based on a time-varying filter-empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD), feature selection, and extreme learning machine (ELM) as an essence regression. The proposed hybridization strategy consists of three main steps for understanding the fundamental behavioral aspects of hourly global solar radiation data. The first phase employs the TVF-EMD algorithm to deal with the variability of global solar radiation data by separating it into a series of more stable and constant subseries. Then, the feature selection step is employed to evaluate and identify distinctive features set from the whole decomposed subseries by means of the RReliefF algorithm. The selected feature sets are used to train and optimize our forecasting extreme learning machine model, then the tuned ELM model is used to assess the forecasting accuracy. The proposed TVF-EMD-RF-ELM model is evaluated and validated in different regions in Algeria with various climate conditions. The forecasting findings of the TVF-EMD algorithm demonstrate high accuracy compared to the recent version of empirical mode decomposition CEEMDAN. Overall forecasting periods, the TVF-EMD-RF-ELM model produces an error less than 8.3% in terms of normalized root mean square error nRMSE in all studied regions.},

Evolution of ECMWF sub-seasonal forecast skill scores over the past 10 years Abstract Sub-seasonal forecasts have been routinely produced at ECMWF since 2002 with re-forecasts produced "on the fly" to calibrate the real-time sub-seasonal forecasts. In this study, the skill of the re-forecasts from April 2002 to March 2012 and covering a common set of years (1995 to 2001) has been evaluated. Results indicate that the skill of the ECMWF re-forecasts to predict the Madden Julian Oscillation has improved significantly since 2002, with an average gain of about 1 day of predictability per year. The amplitude of the MJO has also become more realistic, although the model still tends to produce MJOs which are weaker than in the ECMWF re-analysis. As a consequence, the ability of the ECMWF model to simulate realistic MJO teleconnections over the northern and southern Extratropics has improved dramatically over the past 10 years. Forecast skill scores have also improved in the Extratropics. For instance, weekly mean forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index are significantly more skillful in recent years than ten years ago. A large part of this improvement seems to be linked to the improvements in the representation of the Madden Julian Oscillation. Skill to predict 2-metre temperature anomalies over the northern Extratropics has also improved almost continuously since 2002, with a gain of almost a week of predictability in the last weeks of the sub-seasonal forecasts. Changes in the horizontal and vertical resolutions of the atmospheric model had only a small impact on the skill scores, suggesting that most of the improvements in the ECMWF sub-seasonal forecasts were due to changes in model physics which were primarily designed to improve the model climate and medium-range forecasts.},

The importance of different input variables in the prediction was also a key focus of this study.

Results showed that the use of past water level data denotes a higher impact on the output compared to the other input features such as rainfall, for both architectures.

   abstract = {Transformer neural networks (TNNs) have caused a paradigm shift in deep learning domains like natural language processing, gathering immense interest due to their versatility in other fields such as time series forecasting (TSF). Most current TSF applications of TNNs use only historic observations to predict future events, ignoring information available in weather forecasts to inform better predictions, and with little attention given to the interpretability of the model's use of explanatory inputs. This work explores the potential for TNNs to perform TSF across multiple environmental variables (streamflow, stage, water temperature, and salinity) in two ecologically important regions: the Peace River watershed (Florida) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Louisiana). The TNN was tested and its prediction uncertainty quantified for each response variable from one-to fourteen-day-ahead forecasts using past observations and spatially distributed weather forecasts. A sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed on the trained TNNs' attention weights to identify the relative influence of each input variable on each response variable across prediction windows. Overall model performance ranged from good to very good (0.78 < NSE < 0.99 for all variables and forecast horizons). Through the SA, we found that the TNN was able to learn the physical patterns behind the data, adapt the use of input variables to each forecast, and increasingly use weather forecast information as prediction windows increased. The TNN's excellent performance and flexibility, along with the intuitive interpretability highlighting the logic behind the models' forecasting decision-making process, provide evidence for the applicability of this architecture to other TSF variables and locations.},

However, the existing research mainly focus on model structure adjustment and input feature selection, ignoring the influence of model ensemble on prediction. In this paper, a novel multi-model ensemble method, namely deep learning multi-dimensional ensemble method, is proposed to deal with multi-step runoff prediction problem. The method, which can significantly improve the runoff prediction performance, couples two ensemble techniques with different functional dimensions, namely snapshot ensemble and attention ensemble. Snapshot ensemble technique is used to enhance model generalization capabilities from single-model dimension. While, attention ensemble technique is employed to increase model prediction accuracy from multi-model dimension. Furthermore, a novel data-driven model, called deep learning multi-dimensional ensemble model, is proposed by combining three different deep learning neural networks with deep learning multi-dimensional ensemble method. The proposed model is applied in a real-world case study in the upstream of Yangtze River basin. Three evaluation indicators and ten comparative models are used to test the model performance. The test results not only show the superiority of proposed model over other comparison models, but also prove the effectiveness of the deep learning multi-dimensional ensemble method. The study highlights the power of the ensemble of deep learning model and the promising prospect of our deep learning multi-dimensional ensemble method in hydrological predictions.},

   abstract = {Deep learning-based flood prediction methods have demonstrated significant potential for rapid simulation and early warning of flood disasters. Existing flood surrogate models typically require developing diverse deep-learning architectures based on multiple flood-driving factors, making it challenging to apply these models to different flood scenarios within a consistent network architecture. The temporal resolution of predicted flood maps is also inherently constrained by input flood-driving factors. This paper conceptualizes flood modeling as the translation from coarse-grid to fine-grid flood maps and proposes a novel spatiotemporal flood simulation method termed SwinFlood. The flood-driving factors are unified into two-dimensional coarse-grid hydrodynamic features and fused with fine-grid static terrain features. Utilizing the Swin Transformer for deep feature extraction, the model ultimately outputs fine-grid flood maps. A multi-level model evaluation approach is implemented to systematically assess the performance of the SwinFlood model at global, local, and pixel levels. The proposed model is applied to a complex urban–rural catchment in the upper reaches of the Shenzhen River. Compared to physics-based models, the results demonstrate that the SwinFlood model effectively captures the spatiotemporal variations of water depth, velocity, and river discharge, achieving a speed-up ratio exceeding 1900. The SwinFlood model outperforms traditional purely CNN-based models with comparable parameters. This study provides an efficient and accurate deep-learning method for real-time flood simulation and management.},

   abstract = {Quantitative precipitation forecasting in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models is contingent upon physicals parameterization schemes. However, uncertainties abound due to limited knowledge of the precipitating processes, leading to degraded forecasting skills. In light of this, our study explores the application of a Swin-Transformer based deep learning (DL) model as a supplementary tool for enhancing the mapping trajectory between the NWP fundamental variables and the most downstream variable precipitation. Constrained by the observational satellite precipitation product from NOAA CPC Morphing Technique (CMORPH), the DL model serves as the post-processing tool that can better resolve the precipitation patterns compared to solely based on NWP estimation. Compared to the baseline Weather Research and Forecasting simulation, the DL post-processing effectively extracts features over meteorological variables, leading to improved precipitation skill scores of 21.7%, 60.5%, and 45.5% for light rain, moderate rain, and heavy rain, respectively, on an hourly basis. We also evaluate two case studies under different driven synoptic conditions and show promising results in estimating heavy precipitation during strong convective precipitation events. Overall, the proposed DL model can provide a vital reference for capturing precipitation-triggering mechanisms and enhancing precipitation forecasting skills. Additionally, we discuss the sensitivities of the fundamental meteorological variables used in this study, training strategies, and performance limitations.},

   abstract = {There exists a substantial disparity in the distribution of streamflow gauge and basin characteristic information, with a majority of flood observations being recorded from a limited number of well-monitored locations. Transferring hydrological knowledge from data-rich to data-sparse basins has been a persistent issue. While artificial intelligence methods, such as Long-Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMs) have been attempted for simulating across different basins, the problem of gradient vanishing still inevitably lead to difficulties in responding to new basin datasets. A novel solution is presented in the form of the Transfer Learning Framework based on Transformer (TL-Transformer), which can accurately predict flooding in data-sparse basins (targets) by using models from data-rich basins (sources) without requiring extensive basin attributes at the target location. The framework was demonstrated in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and performance was evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error, and bias. The results show that TL-Transformer outperforms other models, including TOPMODEL, MLP, TL-MLP, LSTM, TL-LSTM and Transformer in all target basin stations. Compared with those models that without transfer learning, TL-Transformer showed significantly improved performance, where NSE increased by 0.2 and reached above 0.75, RMSE and bias were also controlled within 60 and 20, respectively. Furthermore, pre-training on basins with hydrological similarities increases the benefits of Transfer Learning, and we explained this response phenomenon through the topographic index. These results suggest that deep learning can tap into the commonalities in hydrological data across basins to improve the accuracy of flood forecast applications in areas with limited observations.},

   abstract = {Due to its complex and diverse terrain, precipitation gauges in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are sparse, making it difficult to obtain reliable precipitation data for environmental studies. Data merging is a method that can integrate precipitation data from multiple sources to generate high-precision precipitation data. However, the more commonly used methods, such as regression and machine learning, do not usually consider the local correlation of precipitation, so that the spatial pattern of precipitation cannot be reproduced, while deep learning methods do incorporate spatial correlation. To explore the ability of using deep learning methods in merging precipitation data for the TP, this study compared three methods: a deep learning method—a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, a machine learning method—an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, and a statistical method based on Extended Triple Collocation (ETC) in merging precipitation from multiple sources (gauged, grid, satellite and dynamic downscaling) over the TP, as well as their performance for hydrological simulations. Dynamic downscaling data driven by global reanalysis data centered on the TP were introduced in the merging process to better reflect the spatial variability of precipitation. The results show that: (1) in terms of the meteorological metrics, the merged data perform better than the gauge interpolation data. By using data merging, the error between the raw multi-source and gauged precipitation can be reduced, and the precipitation detection capability can be greatly improved; (2) The merged precipitation data also perform well in the hydrological evaluation. The Xin’anjiang (XAJ) model parameter calibration experiments at the source of the Yangtze River (SYR) and the source of the Yellow River (SHR) were repeated 300 times to remove uncertainty in the model parameter results. The median Kling-Gupta Efficiency Coefficients (KGE) of simulated runoff from the merged data of the ANN, CNN and ETC methods for the SYR and the SHR are 0.859, 0.864, 0.838 and 0.835, 0.835, 0.789, respectively. Except for the ETC merging data at the SHR, the performance of other merged data was improved compared to the simulation results of the gauged precipitation (KGE=0.807 at the SYR, KGE=0.828 at the SHR); and (3) In contrast to the machine learning ANN method and the statistical ETC method, the deep learning method, CNN, consistently showed better performance.},

   abstract = {Recent progress in machine learning (ML) inspires the idea of improving (or learning) earth system models directly from the observations. Earth sciences already use data assimilation (DA), which underpins decades of progress in weather forecasting. DA and ML have many similarities: they are both inverse methods that can be united under a Bayesian (probabilistic) framework. ML could benefit from approaches used in DA, which has evolved to deal with real observations - these are uncertain, sparsely sampled, and only indirectly sensitive to the processes of interest. DA could also become more like ML and start learning improved models of the earth system, using parameter estimation, or by directly incorporating machine-learnable models. DA follows the Bayesian approach more exactly in terms of representing uncertainty, and in retaining existing physical knowledge, which helps to better constrain the learnt aspects of models. This article makes equivalences between DA and ML in the unifying framework of Bayesian networks. These help illustrate the equivalences between four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) DA and a recurrent neural network (RNN), for example. More broadly, Bayesian networks are graphical representations of the knowledge and processes embodied in earth system models, giving a framework for organising modelling components and knowledge, whether coming from physical equations or learnt from observations. Their full Bayesian solution is not computationally feasible but these networks can be solved with approximate methods already used in DA and ML, so they could provide a practical framework for the unification of the two. Development of all these approaches could address the grand challenge of making better use of observations to improve physical models of earth system processes.

In order to treat sparse and noisy observations in a rigorous way, ML can be combined with data assimilation (DA). This yields a class of iterative methods in which, at each iteration, a DA step assimilates the observations and alternates with a ML step to learn the underlying dynamics of the DA analysis. In this article, we propose to use this method to correct the error of an existing, knowledge-based model. In practice, the resulting surrogate model is a hybrid model between the original (knowledge-based) model and the ML model. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method numerically using a two-layer, two-dimensional, quasi-geostrophic channel model. Model error is introduced by the means of perturbed parameters. The DA step is performed using the strong-constraint 4D-Var algorithm, while the ML step is performed using deep learning tools. The ML models are able to learn a substantial part of the model error and the resulting hybrid surrogate models produce better short- to mid-range forecasts. Furthermore, using the hybrid surrogate models for DA yields a significantly better analysis than using the original model.},

Whereas impact models typically require high resolution unbiased input data, global and regional climate models are in general biased, their resolution is often lower than desired. Thus, many users of climate model data apply some form of bias correction and downscaling. A fundamental assumption of bias correction is that the considered climate model produces skillful input for a bias correction, including a plausible representation of climate change. Current bias correction methods cannot plausibly correct climate change trends, and have limited ability to downscale. Cross validation of marginal aspects is not sufficient to evaluate bias correction and needs to be complemented by further analyses.

However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39 years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3. Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts.

When designed to emulate operational ensemble forecasts, the generated ones are similar to physics-based ensembles in statistical properties and predictive skill.

   abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distribution F if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ≠ F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage. © 2007 American Statistical Association.},

   abstract = {Some time ago, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was proposed as a new verification tool for (probabilistic) forecast systems. Its focus is on the entire permissible range of a certain (weather) parameter. The CRPS can be seen as a ranked probability score with an infinite number of classes, each of zero width. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the integral of the Brier score over all possible threshold values for the parameter under consideration. For a deterministic forecast system the CRPS reduces to the mean absolute error. In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/ uncertainty part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and the behavior of its outliers. The usefulness of such a decomposition is illustrated for the ensemble prediction system running at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The evaluation of the CRPS and its decomposition proposed in this paper can be extended to systems issuing continuous probability forecasts, by realizing that these can be interpreted as the limit of ensemble forecasts with an infinite number of members.},

   abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

   abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

   abstract = {Current state-of-the-art models typically applied at continental to global scales (hereafter called macroscale) tend to use a priori parameters, resulting in suboptimal streamflow (Q) simulation. For the first time, a scheme for regionalization of model parameters at the global scale was developed. We used data from a diverse set of 1787 small-to-medium sized catchments (10-10,000 km2) and the simple conceptual HBV model to set up and test the scheme. Each catchment was calibrated against observed daily Q, after which 674 catchments with high calibration and validation scores, and thus presumably good-quality observed Q and forcing data, were selected to serve as donor catchments. The calibrated parameter sets for the donors were subsequently transferred to 0.5° grid cells with similar climatic and physiographic characteristics, resulting in parameter maps for HBV with global coverage. For each grid cell, we used the 10 most similar donor catchments, rather than the single most similar donor, and averaged the resulting simulated Q, which enhanced model performance. The 1113 catchments not used as donors were used to independently evaluate the scheme. The regionalized parameters outperformed spatially uniform (i.e., averaged calibrated) parameters for 79% of the evaluation catchments. Substantial improvements were evident for all major Köppen-Geiger climate types and even for evaluation catchments > 5000 km distant from the donors. The median improvement was about half of the performance increase achieved through calibration. HBV with regionalized parameters outperformed nine state-of-the-art macroscale models, suggesting these might also benefit from the new regionalization scheme. The produced HBV parameter maps including ancillary data are available via www.gloh2o.org.},

Using the SWAT platform, four variants of the similarity based regionalization approach were compared. The first two involved unsupervised clustering to define hydrological regions before performing hydrological model calibration, whereas the last two involved supervised clustering after performing calibration. Similarity is defined using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) analysis that identifies watershed physiographic characteristics that are most relevant for the selected hydrological response indices. The PLSR results indicate that typically available watershed characteristics such as geomorphology, land-use, climate, and soil properties describe reasonably well the average hydrological conditions but poorly the extreme events. Regionalization variants considering unsupervised clustering and supervised clustering performed similarly well when using all available information. However, results indicate that supervised clustering uses data more efficiently and may be more suitable when data are scarce. It is demonstrated that parsimonious use of available data can be achieved using both regionalization techniques. Finally, model performance consistently becomes acceptable by calibrating watersheds covering only 10% of the model domain, thus, making the calibration task affordable in terms of time and computational resources required.},

   abstract = {Modern hydrology relies on multiple sources of information combined with climatological, hydrological and glaciological data. These data can be collected through various sources such as private initiatives by companies, research programs, and both national and international organisms. They also vary by types, e.g., in situ measurements, satellite, reanalysis and simulated data. Recently the ANDEX research project, as a GEWEX regional program, was created to understand the processes related to the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes in the Andean region from Colombia to Patagonia. It is quite challenging to carry out this program given the complex orography and diversity of climates from tropical to sub-polar climates. This review article is a compilation of the various databases that are useful for hydrometeorological research in the South American Andes. The National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and Argentina provide a large amount of data however the high-elevation areas are poorly instrumented and the number of stations varies greatly between the countries. National databases are only partially shared with the international bodies responsible for summarizing the existing data; this causes problems in term of data product assimilation. Across the entire continent, too few radiosondes are being used despite the fact that these data are crucial for validating and identifying problems in the atmospheric models. An increasing number of satellite data are available but it is difficult to assimilate them into the hydroclimatological models suited to the adjusted spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, for precipitation, we recommend merged products that account for the high spatial and temporal variability across the Andes. Finally, the international ANDEX program could be an excellent opportunity to increase the knowledge of the hydrological processes in the Andes.},

   abstract = {The South America Low-level Jet (SALLJ) is a climatological feature with a critical role in the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in South America. While previous studies have focused on the mechanisms and variability of the SALLJ in the central Andes (i.e., southeast Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay), the occurrence of the low-level jet in the eastern slopes of the northern Andes (i.e., northeast Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela) and its linkages to the central region have not been previously explored. This study shows that the SALLJ in the northern branch exceeds 10 m s−1 during September–February and the frequency can be as high as in the central region. Moreover, the SALLJ can occur simultaneously or separately in both regions. When the SALLJ is active only in the northern branch, wind speeds are very low from Bolivia towards southeast South America (SESA) and precipitation is significantly reduced (1–4 mm day−1) from climatology. In contrast, precipitation increases over eastern Bolivia by 2–4 mm day−1. Composites suggest that the SALLJ northern branch is forced by a large-scale circulation pattern with the enhancement of the North Atlantic Subtropical High driving northeasterly winds over the northern Andes. Further analysis shows that the frequency and intensity of the SALLJ in the northern Andes has substantially increased in the last 39 years.},

Using the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1979-2012), we show that the convergence of both LLJs over the eastern Pacific-western Colombia contributes to the explanation of the region's world-record rainfall. Diverse variables involved in the transport and storage of moisture permit the identification of an AR over northern South America involving a midtropospheric easterly jet that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Andes, with stronger activity in April to August. Other major seasonal AR pathways constitute part of a large gyre originating over the tropical North Atlantic, veering to the southeast over the eastern Andes and reaching regions of northern Argentina and southeastern Brazil. We illustrate the distribution of average seasonal precipitation along the LLJs and AR pathways with data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (1998-2011), combined with considerations of CAPE, topography, and land cover. In addition, the theory of the biotic pump of atmospheric moisture (BiPAM) is tested at seasonal time scales, and found to hold in 8 out of 12 ARs, and 22 out of 32 forest-covered tracks (64% in distance) along the ARs. Deviations from BiPAM's predictions of rainfall distribution are explained by the effects of topography, orography, and land cover types different from forests. Our results lend a strong observational support to the BiPAM theory at seasonal time scales over South American forested flat lands.

   abstract = {Regional climate modeling using convection-permitting models (CPMs; horizontal grid spacing <4km) emerges as a promising framework to provide more reliable climate information on regional to local scales compared to traditionally used large-scale models (LSMs; horizontal grid spacing >10km). CPMs no longer rely on convection parameterization schemes, which had been identified as a major source of errors and uncertainties in LSMs. Moreover, CPMs allow for a more accurate representation of surface and orography fields. The drawback of CPMs is the high demand on computational resources. For this reason, first CPM climate simulations only appeared a decade ago. In this study, we aim to provide a common basis for CPM climate simulations by giving a holistic review of the topic. The most important components in CPMs such as physical parameterizations and dynamical formulations are discussed critically. An overview of weaknesses and an outlook on required future developments is provided. Most importantly, this review presents the consolidated outcome of studies that addressed the added value of CPM climate simulations compared to LSMs. Improvements are evident mostly for climate statistics related to deep convection, mountainous regions, or extreme events. The climate change signals of CPM simulations suggest an increase in flash floods, changes in hail storm characteristics, and reductions in the snowpack over mountains. In conclusion, CPMs are a very promising tool for future climate research. However, coordinated modeling programs are crucially needed to advance parameterizations of unresolved physics and to assess the full potential of CPMs. Key Points Convection-permitting climate models reduce errors in large-scale models Added value in convective processes, regional extremes, and over mountains Discusses challenges/potentials of convection-permitting climate simulations},

   abstract = {A deep learning model designed for time series predictions, the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, is regularly producing reliable results in local and regional rainfall–runoff applications around the world. Recent large-sample hydrology studies in North America and Europe have shown the LSTM model to successfully match conceptual model performance at a daily time step over hundreds of catchments. Here we investigate how these models perform in producing monthly runoff predictions in the relatively dry and variable conditions of the Australian continent. The monthly time step matches historic data availability and is also important for future water resources planning; however, it provides significantly smaller training datasets than daily time series. In this study, a continental-scale comparison of monthly deep learning (LSTM) predictions to conceptual rainfall–runoff (WAPABA model) predictions is performed on almost 500 catchments across Australia with performance results aggregated over a variety of catchment sizes, flow conditions, and hydrological record lengths. The study period covers a wet phase followed by a prolonged drought, introducing challenges for making predictions outside of known conditions – challenges that will intensify as climate change progresses. The results show that LSTM models matched or exceeded WAPABA prediction performance for more than two-thirds of the study catchments, the largest performance gains of LSTM versus WAPABA occurred in large catchments, the LSTMs struggled less to generalise than the WAPABA models (e.g. making predictions under new conditions), and catchments with few training observations due to the monthly time step did not demonstrate a clear benefit with either WAPABA or LSTM.},

   abstract = {Accurate predictions of monthly extremes assume paramount importance in enabling proactive decision-making, which however are lacked in skills even for state-of-the-art dynamical models. Taking the extreme precipitation prediction over the mid-to-lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China, as an instance, a multi-predictor U-Net deep learning approach is designed to enhance the prediction over the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, with the single-predictor U-Net parallelly examined as the benchmark. Focusing on the precipitation extremes, an extreme associated component is incorporated into the model loss function for optimization. Besides, predictions composed by daily outputs with multiple lead times are imported as a comprehensive set in the training phase to augment the deep learning sample size and to emphasize enhancements in predictions at the monthly timescale as a whole. Results indicate that the multi-predictor U-Net effectively improves predictions of extreme summer precipitation frequency, showing distinct superiority to the raw ECMWF and the single-predictor U-Net. Multiple evaluation metrics indicate that the model shows a significant positive improvement ratio ranging from 65.1% to 80.0% across all grids compared to the raw ECMWF prediction, which has also been validated through applications in the two extreme summer precipitation cases in 2016 and 2020. Besides, a ranking analysis of feature importance reveals that factors such as humidity and temperature play even more crucial roles than precipitation itself in the multi-predictor extreme precipitation prediction model at the monthly timescale. That is, in such a deep learning approach, the monthly prediction on extreme precipitation benefits significantly from the inclusion of multiple associated predictors.},

The efficiency of the proposed models are examined utilizing diverse evaluation criteria namely mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). The modeling result inherits that the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieves a greater accuracy than other compared models. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model significantly reduces the forecasting error compared to the models for the one month time step ahead.

Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present9,10 and future11, 12–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series14, 15–16. Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet17. Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments14, 15–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles12,16,18, which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century11,12,18.},

   abstract = {Precipitation is an important component of the hydrological cycle and has significant impact on ecological environment and social development, especially in arid areas where water resources are scarce. As a typical arid and semi-arid region, the Mongolian Plateau is ecologically fragile and highly sensitive to climate change. Reliable global precipitation data is urgently needed for the sustainable development over this gauge-deficient region. With high-quality estimates, fine spatiotemporal resolutions, and wide coverage, the state-of-the-art Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) and European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) have great potential for regional climatic, hydrological, and ecological applications. However, how they perform has not been well investigated on the Mongolian Plateau. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of three IMERG V06 datasets (ER, LR and FR), two ERA5 products (ERA5-HRES and ERA5-Land), and their predecessors (TMPA-3B42 and ERA-Interim) over the region across 2001–2018. The results showed that all products broadly characterized seasonal precipitation cycles and spatial patterns, but only the three reanalysis products, IMERG FR and TMPA-3B42 could capture interannual and decadal variability. When describing daily precipitation, dataset performances ranked ERA5-Land > ERA5-HRES > ERA-Interim > IMERG FR > IMERG LR > IMERG ER > TMPA-3B42. All products showed deficiencies in overestimating weak precipitation and underestimating high-intensity precipitation. Besides, products performed best in agricultural lands and forests along the northern and south-eastern edges, followed by urban areas and grasslands closer to the center, and worst in the sparse vegetation and bare areas of the south-west. Due to a negative effect of topographic complexity, IMERG showed poor detection capabilities in forests. Accordingly, this research currently supports the applicability of reanalysis ERA5 data over the arid, topographically complex Mongolian Plateau, which can inform regional applications with different requirements.},

   abstract = {Estimating future short-duration extreme precipitation in mountainous regions is fundamental for risk management. High-resolution convection-permitting models (CPMs) represent the state of the art for these projections, as they resolve convective processes that are key to short-duration extremes. Recent observational studies reported a decrease in the intensity of extreme hourly precipitation with elevation. This "reverse orographic effect"could be related to processes which are subgrid even for CPMs. To quantify the reliability of future projections of extreme short-duration precipitation in mountainous regions, it is thus crucial to understand to what extent CPMs can reproduce this effect. Due to the computational demands however, CPM simulations are still too short for analyzing extremes using conventional methods. We use a non-asymptotic statistical approach (Simplified Metastatistical Extreme Value: SMEV) for the analysis of extremes from short time periods, such as the ones of CPM simulations. We analyze an ERA-Interim-driven Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO-crCLIM, convection-resolving Climate Modelling) simulation (2000-2009; 2.2 km resolution), and we use hourly precipitation from 174 rain gauges in an orographically complex area in northeastern Italy as a benchmark. We investigate the ability of the model to simulate the orographic effect on short-duration precipitation extremes, as compared to observational data. We focus on extremes as high as the 20-year return levels. While overall good agreement is reported at daily and hourly duration, the CPM tends to increasingly overestimate hourly extremes with increasing elevation, implying that the reverse orographic effect is not fully captured. These findings suggest that CPM bias-correction approaches should account for orography. SMEV's capability of estimating reliable rare extremes from short periods promises further applications on short-time-period CPM projections and model ensembles. Copyright:},

   abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth’s glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000–2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267 ± 16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21 ± 3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48 ± 16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7–9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

   abstract = {Soil degradation is a critical threat to agriculture and food security around the world. Understanding the processes that drive soil erosion is necessary to support sustainable management practices and to reduce eutrophication of water systems from fertilizer runoff. The erosivity of precipitation is a primary control on the rate of soil erosion, but to calculate erosivity high-frequency precipitation data are required. Prior global-scale analysis has almost exclusively used ground-based rainfall gauges to calculate erosivity, but the advent of high-frequency satellite rainfall data provides an opportunity to estimate erosivity using globally consistent gridded satellite rainfall. In this study, I have tested the use of IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM, Global Precipitation Mission) rainfall data to calculate global rainfall erosivity. I have tested three different approaches to assess whether simplification of IMERG data allows for robust calculation of erosivity, finding that the highest-frequency 30 min data are needed to best replicate gauge-based estimates. I also find that in areas where ground-based gauges are sparse, there is more disparity between the IMERG-derived estimates and the ground-based results, suggesting that IMERG may allow for improved erosivity estimates in data-poor areas. The global extent and accessibility of IMERG data allow for regular calculation of erosivity in a month-to-month time frame, permitting improved dynamic characterization of rainfall erosivity across the world in near-real time. These results demonstrate the value of satellite data to assess the impact of rainfall on soil erosion and may benefit practitioners of sustainable land management planning.},

   abstract = {A validation covering a 30-year period (1987–2016) of the relatively new CHIRPS precipitation dataset was performed over the Central Andes of Argentina (CAA), a semi-arid region with complex topography and sparse ground observations. Precipitation data from 57 rain gauges and several well-known continuous and categorical validation statistics were assessed to evaluate the performance of CHIRPS estimations. The study area was divided into two zones based on the timing of the rainy season maximum, in order to determine regional differences in the characterization of precipitation patterns. The results of this study indicate that CHIRPS data reproduce adequately several characteristics of precipitation along the study area, as the seasonal and interannual variability and the spatial patterns of precipitation. CHIRPS dataset is able to capture the rainy season characteristics over the CAA, considering the Mediterranean climate features over the Andes ranges and the monsoonal regime in the lowlands. CHIRPS achieves better results for the stations located in the region with summer precipitation maximum, mostly located over Cuyo region (correlation = 0.86, bias = 11%, mean absolute error = 15.3 mm). Despite the strong correlation of 0.82 over Northern Patagonia region, CHIRPS showed a significant overestimation of the seasonal precipitation totals during the cold semester (April to September, bias = 65.8%, mean absolute error = 34.7 mm). These systematic errors can be attributed to the poor performance of CHIRPS in reproducing the precipitation features over the zones above 1000 m.a.s.l. One of the reasons behind the observed differences can be attributed to the limited number of anchor stations used in the CHIRPS calculation procedure, which highlights this study as an independent validation given the amount of meteorological stations used.},

   abstract = {Predicting rainfall is a challenging and critical task due to its significant impact on society. Timely and accurate predictions are essential for minimizing human and financial losses. The dependence of approximately 60% of agricultural land in India on monsoon rainfall implies the crucial nature of accurate rainfall prediction. Precise rainfall forecasts can facilitate early preparedness for disasters associated with heavy rains, enabling the public and government to take necessary precautions. In the North-Western Himalayas, where meteorological data are limited, the need for improved accuracy in traditional modeling methods for rainfall forecasting is pressing. To address this, our study proposes the application of advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) along with various deep learning (DL) algorithms such as long short-term memory (LSTM), bi-directional LSTM, deep LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and simple recurrent neural network (RNN). These advanced techniques hold the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of rainfall prediction, offering hope for more reliable forecasts. Additionally, time series techniques, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and trigonometric, Box-Cox transform, arma errors, trend, and seasonal components (TBATS), are proposed for predicting rainfall across the altitudinal gradients of India’s North-Western Himalayas. This approach can potentially revolutionise how we approach rainfall forecasting, ushering in a new era of accuracy and reliability. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithms were assessed using meteorological data obtained from six weather stations at different elevations spanning from 1980 to 2021. The results indicate that DL methods exhibit the highest accuracy in predicting rainfall, as measured by the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), followed by ML algorithms and time series techniques. Among the DL algorithms, the accuracy order was bi-directional LSTM, LSTM, RNN, deep LSTM, and GRU. For the ML algorithms, the accuracy order was ANN, KNN, SVR, and RF. These findings suggest that altitude significantly affects the accuracy of the models, highlighting the need for additional weather stations in this mountainous region to enhance the precision of rainfall prediction.},

To make a multi-step monthly rainfall prediction and discover the primary factors affecting rainfall, this study presents an explainable deep learning approach that integrates four consecutive modules, namely the Gated-Recurrent-Unit-based (GRU-based) encoder module, attention mechanism module, GRU-based decoder module, and expected-gradient-based explanation module, respectively. The first three modules constitute an encoder-decoder with an attention mechanism which could predict monthly rainfall in multiple continuous months in the future, while the explanation module computes attribution values for the input weather and climate features to quantify their importance. A case study is conducted on monthly rainfall data collected from Darwin and Perth, Australia, from Jan 1921 to Dec 2020. The results mainly indicate that: (1) Compared with the baseline methods, the multi-step monthly rainfall predictions made by the encoder-decoder with an attention mechanism show better agreement with the ground truth. (2) For January rainfall in Darwin, the most important weather factors are last January and February rainfall, while the most critical climate index is last February's Southern Oscillation Index, with its high values inhibit while low values promote January rainfall in Darwin. (3) The most significant feature for June rainfall in Perth is last June's solar radiation whose feature value is weakly negatively correlated with its attribution value. The study's significance lies in enhancing the accuracy of multi-step rainfall prediction and providing interpretability through identification of influential factors, which facilitates long-term planning of water resources and deeper understanding of complex weather systems.},

A comprehensive comparison is conducted with other models including back propagation (BP), LSTM, etc. The assessment of each model’s prediction performance uses four evaluation indexes.

Multivariate time series models incorporating lagged meteorological variables were employed to capture the dynamics of monthly rainfall in Rabat, Morocco, from 1993 to 2018. The models were evaluated based on various metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2).

In contrast, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, and KNN showed relatively lower performances, with specific RMSEs ranging from 47.5 (mm) to 51 (mm). A novel multi-view stacking learning approach is introduced, offering a new perspective on various ML strategies. This integrated algorithm is designed to leverage the strengths of each individual model, aiming to substantially improve the precision of precipitation forecasts. The best results were achieved by combining Decision Tree, KNN, and LSTM to build the meta-base while using XGBoost as the second-level learner. This approach yielded a RMSE of 17.5 millimeters.

The ensemble prediction results of the CEEMDAN-BMA model were analysed based on six evaluation indices. The results show that the CEEMDAN-BMA model performs well in terms of monthly precipitation prediction for both the Beijing and Guangzhou stations. The RMSE, MAE, and R2 values of the monthly precipitation prediction results for the Beijing station are 22.355 mm, 14.973 mm, and 0.897, respectively, and the RMSE, MAE, and R2 values of the monthly precipitation prediction results for the Guangzhou station are 35.86 mm, 28.371 mm, and 0.932, respectively. In addition, the CEEMDAN-BMA model provides a 90% confidence interval (CI) to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction results. The coverage of the 90% CI of the CEEMDAN-BMA model for the Beijing station is 91.67%, the average width is 82.76 mm, and the average offset is 0.009 mm; the coverage of the 90% CI for the Guangzhou station is 96.67%, the average width is 143.84 mm, and the average offset is 0.059 mm.

To address the uncertainty and nonlinear characteristics of precipitation series, this paper uses the established improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN)-wavelet signal denoising (WSD)-bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and echo state network (ESN) models to predict precipitation of four cities in southern Anhui Province. The BiLSTM is used to predict the high-frequency components and the ESN to predict the low-frequency components, thus avoiding the influence between the two neural network predictions. The results show that the ICEEMDAN-WSD-BiLSTM and ESN models are more accurate. The average relative error reached 2.64% and the NSE (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient) was 0.91, which was significantly better than the other four models. The model reveals the temporal change pattern and evolution characteristics of future precipitation, guides flood prevention and mitigation, and has certain theoretical significance and application value for promoting regional sustainable development.},

   abstract = {This study introduces a novel Hybrid Ensemble Machine-Learning (HEML) algorithm to merge long-term satellite-based reanalysis precipitation products (SRPPs), enabling the estimation of super drought events in the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) during the period of 1984 to 2019. This study considers three widely used Machine learning (ML) models, including RF (Random Forest), GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine), and KNN (k-nearest Neighbors), for the emerging HEML approach. The three SRPPs, including CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station), ERA5-Land, and PERSIANN-CDR (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network-Climate Data Record), were used to merge for developing new precipitation estimates from HEML model. Additionally, classification and regression models were employed as base learners in developing this algorithm. The newly developed HEML datasets were compared with other ML and SRPP products for super-drought monitoring. The Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was used to estimate super drought characteristics, including Drought frequency (DF), Drought Duration (DD), and Drought Intensity (DI) from machine learning and SRPPs products in LVB and compared with RG observation. The results revealed that the HEML algorithm shows excellent performance (CC = 0.93) compared to the single ML merging method and SRPPs against observation. Furthermore, the HEML merging product adeptly captures the spatiotemporal patterns of super drought characteristics during both training (1984–2009) and testing (2010–2019) periods. This research offers crucial insights for near-real-time drought monitoring, water resource management, and informed policy decisions.},
